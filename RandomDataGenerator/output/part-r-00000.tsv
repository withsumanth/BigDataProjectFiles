I would not recommend upgrading from Office 2010. If you do not have Office 2010, see if you can live with the competition (OpenOffice, Google Drive) before buying this.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />About a month ago, I installed Windows 8 and the final version of Office 2013 on a Dell XPS 13. A bit about me: I'm a graduate student and a long-time user of Microsoft Office. I've used Word, Excel, Powerpoint and OneNote almost every day for the past 5 years, but OneNote the most by far. I've used every version of Office since 1997.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the biggest changes to Office 2013 from Office 2010 are SkyDrive integration, touch gestures, and a flatter UI to match Windows 8. Since I don't use SkyDrive often, don't have a touchscreen, and am indifferent to the flatter look, I'll leave those aspects to other reviews. If you're like me and aren't particularly excited by SkyDrive (which still isn't as versatile as Google Docs for real-time collaboration), then Office 2013 is practically the same as Office 2010 in terms of how everything works - most of the time. This is not a bad thing, at least in my opinion, since I really liked Office 2010 and its improved Ribbon UI.<br /><br />What I wanted to talk about here are the changes that Microsoft has made to Office 2013 from Office 2010 that I've noticed, changes that might impact daily workflow for users upgrading from previous Office versions.<br /><br />OneNote 2013:<br />---------------<br />I spend at least 4 hours a day in this program, so I'll start with this. As far as I can tell, there are no significant changes in terms of features. Buttons on the ribbon are shuffled around a bit, but the feature set is still the same, as is the file container (*.one) and notebook type (\\"OneNote 2010-2013\\").<br /><br />However, there are 5 new issues that annoy me every single day.<br />(1) Full screen and pinning the ribbon. In 2013, going into full screen mode means that everything is hidden, except for a very short horizontal bar across the top of the screen. To access anything on the ribbon, I have to click on this bar to show the ribbon first. If I want to pin the ribbon so that tabs are visible at all times in full screen mode, I have to click on this bar, click a menu button near the minimize button (also hidden in full screen), and then click Show Tabs. However, OneNote does not remember this setting. Thus, every time I exit full screen mode or restart OneNote and then reenter full screen mode, I have to re-pin the ribbon again. On an ultrabook, I want more space for taking notes, but I also use the ribbon extensively and would prefer to have it available. This problem did not exist in OneNote 2010, which remembers the user's full-screen ribbon settings.<br />(2) Inserting multi-page printouts. The new default behavior in OneNote 2013 is to place each page of the printout on a separate \\"page\\" of the notebook. I prefer to put one entire lecture on each \\"notebook page\\", regardless of how many pages or slides the professor gives us. I've also never come across anyone who prefers to have only one printout page on each notebook page. So for instance, if I were inserting a 30-slide Powerpoint, OneNote 2013 would create 30 new notebook pages. There is an option to turn this off in the options, but OneNote then shows a dialog box asking me to choose between the two options every time I want to insert a printout. Since I insert several files a day, this gets annoying very quickly. Once again, OneNote 2010 did not have this problem.<br />(3) Inserting more than 1 multi-page printout on the same notebook page. If I try this, then the second printout is somehow inserted under the first printout, i.e. the first printout overlaps and covers up the second printout. It only happens when the printouts are both at least several pages long or if I've annotated the page already; the program disregards my cursor location. To work around this, I have to put the second printout on a new notebook page and then copy/paste the printout pages back to the first notebook page. This problem also did not exist in OneNote 2010.<br />(4) Zoom level changes when inserting printout: it always defaults back to 100%. I take notes at 115% on my ultrabook, so every time I insert a printout, I have to readjust the zoom level.<br />(5) Drawing tools. I have no idea how Microsoft managed to mess this up when going from 2010 to 2013, but half the time I try to draw an arrow, it ends up being a line with a V in the middle, or the arrowhead is completely detached from the line. In fact, I can't even draw a plain line properly sometimes. I haven't tried the other shapes much, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were problems there too. I've given up and resorted to drawing arrows freehand with the pen tool instead.<br /><br />These issues may seem minor to some, but they affect me every day, so I wanted to give a heads-up to anyone else who uses OneNote the same way I do. I wish that Microsoft had spent more time implementing useful features (e.g. still can't rotate or crop a printout; search results are still clunky) or at least providing options to change these new behaviors in settings.<br /><br />Word 2013:<br />--------------<br />Now, when you open up Word (and Excel/Powerpoint), you're presented with a selection of templates instead of just a blank document, which is one extra click away (this can be turned off in Options). Other than that, the feature set for Word has remained largely the same. I have noticed significant lag when saving large Word documents, even to SSD - I was working on a 20MB file and Word would freeze up for 10-15 seconds every time I saved, despite my computer being pretty new. I tried tweaking the settings, disabling hardware acceleration, etc, but nothing helped. This was not an issue in Word 2010 either.<br /><br />One of the most touted new features of Word 2013 is the ability to open PDF files for editing, but I have attempted to open and edit several documents, and Word does a horrible job of preserving formatting. I have third-party conversion software that almost always gets the formatting correct, no matter how complex, so this was a disappointment. I even tried to open a PDF file that was created from a simple Word document, and Word failed to properly center the title. I would not recommend relying on this feature.<br /><br />Excel/Powerpoint 2013:<br />----------------------<br />I haven't had much of a chance to work extensively with these programs, but other than the template selection page when first opening the programs, they seem pretty much the same as Office 2010. Saving large files in Powerpoint 2013 usually seems okay, unlike in Word 2013. Powerpoint now defaults to 16:9 aspect ratio for slides, which is nice. There are some nice additions and tweaks to the Design tab in Powerpoint, but nothing spectacular. Excel has some handy pattern-recognition auto-fill functions now which seem to work well.<br /><br />One more thing about Word/Excel/Powerpoint: Microsoft decided to add transitions to everything, which I find distracting. For example, when you type in Word, the letters fade into the page instead of simply appearing, and the cursor glides to the right. In Excel, when recalculating cells, the new values fade in, like a ripple effect. In Powerpoint, when applying a new background, it fades into all the slides as it is applied. There is no way to turn this off except through a registry tweak.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />------------<br />It may seem like I'm being overly critical of Office 2013, but I immensely enjoyed using Office 2010, and much of that experience has carried over here. Office 2013 will undoubtedly stand as the new standard of office suites this year. Microsoft Office remains a powerful and invaluable set of software for people in academia or business, which is why I'm still giving it 3.5 (~4) stars. But at best, Office 2013 is simply Office 2010 with SkyDrive integration and touch gestures. If you're like me, Office 2013 introduces little to no new functionality and a handful of new bugs and quirks that interfere with daily workflow. My advice? If you're considering upgrading from pre-2010, then I would recommend Office 2010, especially in light of the annual subscription-based model Microsoft is pursuing for Office 2013. If you're already on Office 2010 and are happy, I would not recommend upgrading to Office 2013.<br /><br />UPDATE - SkyDrive collaboration<br />-------------------------------------------<br />Recently, I tried using SkyDrive, Office Web Apps (free version), and Office 2013 together to collaborate on some files with other people, and the experience is a far cry from Google Docs. I will preface this by saying that I am not using the subscription/corporate versions of Office Web Apps, which (I believe) have better collaboration features. This is for users who want to buy the retail copy of Office 2013 and/or are considering using Skydrive and the free Office Web Apps to work on files with other people.<br />(1) Changes are not synced in real time - for instance, if someone makes an edit, all other users who have the file open must manually save and refresh the document to see changes.<br />(2) Conflicts. After the manual save/refresh, Skydrive roughly merges everything together - so, for instance, if both users write a sentence, both sentences will appear after the first user syncs their changes, the second user syncs the first user's changes plus their own changes, and the first user syncs yet again. If two users try to edit the same word, Skydrive gives an error message, complaining of a conflict and asking the user to manually resolve each problem. If this sounds like a mess, it's because it is.<br />(3) There is no indication of what other users are editing, where their cursors are, what they're looking at, etc., unlike Google Docs.<br />(4) In Excel, if a desktop user on Excel 2013 is editing the spreadsheet, then no other users can edit it.<br />(5) In Powerpoint, text appears in a different size and font when being edited, then reverts back after the user exits the text box...why?<br />(6) The web apps have been stripped of nearly all features, even basic things like header/footer in Word. This is to be expected, since it's free, but it also means that Google Docs provides a superior experience, at least for word processing.<br />I shudder to think how badly this system would work when trying to get a significant amount of work done. Google Docs may be inadequate for many power-user tasks, but it is absolutely outstanding when it comes to real-time collaboration - I've written 100+ page papers with other people using Google Docs, and while further formatting is always required in Word after everything is written, we've never had a problem with seeing exactly what has been written at any given time. Microsoft's free solution does not hold up well at all for multi-user scenarios; it really only works as a backup solution for single user use.	2013-02-02

Worked 'partially' for a while until I started receiving error code CC-506 which apparently 'tech support' has no idea on how to resolve.  They will only tell you to 'try again'.  The error code relates to not communicating with the bank and a phone call to the bank indicated that they had multiple calls on this issue.  The bank suggested I go back to an older version. This error code generates a message from Quicken telling you your bank account no longer exists.  That will get your attention!  Also, with another investment account Quicken likes to code electronic withdrawals as transfers which does not result in money getting subtracted.

Sometimes it's a little over done, but she does have the vocal chops to sing a lot better then most. I feel she could find better production to make her stuff more mainstream. But enough of that on with the album reviews.    I first saw this album in my best friend's cd collection. I had to listen to it since it was a free listen. I really enjoyed it a lot. She sounds strong and the songs are well produced. They sound less poppy and more mature. You can tell she really puts herself into these songs. Her voice really shines on the songs like I Have Loved You, Underneath, Don't Have to Let Go(This is one of my  FAVS!!!!) and My Way Home. The album is filled with a lot of slower stuff. So if you are in the mood to just relax, it`s best for that.     My personal favorite is Everyday See You. It has a very refreshing feel to it. Her voice sounds so sweet and you can tell she is having a great time thinking about whoever this great guy is.It's Nick at this point obviously.) The great thing about this album I feel is she shows that her music is all about 2 things. One which is showing her vocals are to reckon with and 2 she is deeply delved into the messages in her songs and truly feels them with each word uttered.     This is a solid album for anyone who loves ballads and slower numbers. Grab it. I feel this is her best work. Public Affair is more upbeat but I don't think it beats this album. These songs are well produced, and I believe they will stand the test of time. I was just listening to her album yesterday and it doesn't sound dated at all.	2009-07-09

While waiting impatiently for their next holiday album, I was delighted to see that Straight No Chaser had released an EP.  I listened to the samples, then downloaded the entire group of songs.  They've been playing on rotation all evening, and I still can't get enough of a couple of them.<br /><br />The good:  The harmonies are tight, music is lovely, and the songs \\"I'm Yours/Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\" and \\"Signed, Sealed, and Delivered\\" are absolutely delightful.  I've never heard a version of \\"Rainbow\\" that I've liked--even Judy Garland sounded sappy, IMHO--but this was a pleasant surprise.  \\"You Send Me\\" and \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\\" are charming, and a joy to listen to, although they don't sparkle quite as much as the other two songs I mentioned. They're still excellent, and I'd love to see them performed live, I was just hoping for something that had more snap.<br /><br />The bad:  \\"Rehab\\" was surprisingly flat, for Straight No Chaser.  It's very well done, but I expected it to be more exuberant.  \\"Man Who Can't Be Moved\\" is truly beautiful, it's just bloody sad, and after a few listens, I clicked it off on the iPod lineup.  For those not looking for peppy happy music, you'll love it.<br /><br />Conclusion:  The entire EP is well worth purchasing, this is the Straight No Chaser that we all fell in love with, and it's enough of their gorgeous sound in a non-holiday format to keep fans happy until their next album, Christmas Cheers, comes out.  Some of the songs are mellower than the fan favorite \\"Twelve Days of Christmas\\", but they're all very good. Buy it, you won't regret it!	2009-09-02

Along with the Plainsong album In Search Of Amelia Earhart, these were the first of his albums I heard - and there are some great songs on all of them.  But, for me, there is not enough quality in depth to make them stand out records.  I think the problem is partly in the crossover from folk to rock or country-rock, illustrated most clearly in Old Man At The Mill.  Other reviewers see it differently but, despite the quality of the playing, it's a song that I can't relate to at all, which is my problem with traditional folk music in general.  Country has a similar effect on me - often quoted as being three chords and the truth, I find traditional country more often sounds like three chords and some cliches.  Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of contemporary country where lyrics get more deeply into the subject matter than, \\"My woman's been untrue, she's gone and found somebody knew\\" (Blue Blue Day).  For me the strongest tracks on Valley Hi are Iain's own Keep On Sailing and his stellar (probably the best) cover of These Days.  The other tracks are also-rans and, again, contrary to other reviews, I find Nesmith's production unsubtle to say the least.  For me Some Days You Eat The Bear is a better record, not muddy in production as another reviewer has said, and side one is as good a side of music as Iain has recorded.  Ol' 55 was not recorded three years later by The Eagles, their On The Border album was released the same year as Some Days.. I Don't Want To Talk About It is a far better version than Rod Stewart's and I believe Rod would not have recorded it if it hadn't been for this version.  And then Everything But The Girl wouldn't have done it either....  A Wailing Goodbye is a grower, and a fine tribute to Gram Parsons, followed by a more subtle version of Keep On Sailing and a great cover of Gene Clark's Tried So Hard.      These records do illustrate what a fine pure voice Matthews has and that he has an ear for a good song, and that this ear has possibly influenced other artists.  I give four stars rather than three mainly because the two albums in one package is hard to resist.	2010-01-17

Doesn't make any noise.  Perhaps a bit slow to start up and shut down, but a minor complaint.  Plays most every video and audio I've put by it.  But it does have one annoying feature.  The very first firmware version it shipped with had subtitles enabled by default.  I mean, obviously everyone wants subtitles if they are available, right?  I thought not.  Fortunately they provided the ability to turn them off in the menu.  One learned right quick how to access that menu option.  The current firmware version not only enables them by default, but reenabled them when one turns them off.  So you fire up your movie, roll your eyes at the text, hit pause, go to menu, select subtitles, scroll through all the languages to get to off, hit enter, close the menu, hit play and Bingo!  subtitles are reenabled because Patriot just KNOWS you want them.  Just because you accidentally turned them off is no reason to stop your audience from enjoying some nice white text blasted across half the screen.  So you do it again.  You hit pause, you select menu, you hit subtitles, you scroll through all the languages to off.  You hit enter.  You close the menu.  You hit play.  Bingo!  Subtitles are reenabled!  Yay!	2011-08-05

I think the tweed design on this case complimented with dark brown faux leather accents is a great alternative to the plain black cases, and probably less tempting to wood-be thieves. The case fits the nook snugly and has cut outs to access all the areas that you might need to access. The front flap and the flip out stand on the back are secured in place with magnets that seem to be the perfect strength to keep it shut when it needs to be. The materials are sturdy enough to provide good protection and durability and the workmanship  seems to be good quality. Overall, 5 stars, very good case.   The only slight complaints I have with the case are:  1) that the faux leather strips that run adjacent to the page forward and page back buttons are just a little bit in the way, the buttons are still usable though. I rarely use the buttons and would deduct 1/10th of one star from my review for this slight annoyance.  2) overpriced, 30$ for a tiny little case that can fit in a large pocket seems a bit excessive.	2011-09-03

TrueHD playback, fully compatible with my receiver and my TV. It doesn't look bad and functions well. The apps work much better on this player than on my TV. I wish it had more apps though. It has a dedicated red netflix button on the remote which I don't like much. I would ditch the remote and just use my receiver remote but there are buttons that don't work on other remotes so you'll need to keep it around. Other than that, great player and a decent price.	2011-10-30

On PAPER, this TV was merely competitive in terms of features and price. Its only when I actually went and saw it live and in person along side dozens of other sets on a show room wall... did I come to the realization that there was no comparison. This set was by far the best in it class. It even rivalled the top of the line LEDs cost $1000 more.   The Sharp Quattron is strikingly vivid - so life like, in fact, that we often comment that its just like being on the set of our favorite sitcom, or sitting in an IMAX theater watching \\"Blue Planet\\" in HD. The colors, particularly colors that include yellow, are \\"true to life.\\"   But frankly none of that matters - what matters is how it looks when watching football. This is where it REALLY excels. Maybe its the extra yellow capable pixels, don't know... aall I know is the grass looks more real than the real grass I see outside my window (\\"grass is always greener on the others side of the scree?\\". The acuity of the picture is so sharp that I can actually see and make the \\"close calls\\" in most football games before the announcers or the refs. Absolutely no blur or ghoasting even watching Sammy Watkins run.  Oh, and I'm finally watching hockey for the first time in a long time because NOW, I can actually see and follow the puck.  The only problem is, now all my friends (who all own their own HD big screens) want to come to my house to watch the game. The beer bill is killing me. But the \\"ews\\" and \\"awes\\" and comments about how great the picture is make it all worth while.  BTW if you think this review is a little too \\"gushy\\" to be real, I can assure you it's not. Nine time out of ten when I write a review its to warn fellow consumers about some \\"horrible\\" product or truly bad online shopping experienc. But its also the reason that I bother to take the time to write about that one in 10 products GOOD products that truely stands out.... in this case... head and shoulders above the pack. The Sharp Quattron is one of those products.   So much so, that I'm about to buy another. I couldn't be more please with my purchase. Good Show Sharp! But don't take more word for it... do yourself a favor and see it for yourself. You'll be blown away just like I was.  Happy Viewing!  BBBoy	2011-11-05

I was disappointed to purchase this graphics card (through TigerDirect) and not have my Win 8 computer (HP 1446s, Dec 2012) recognize it (no video whatever on my two monitor system).  Out of the box it is not compatible with Secure Boot (not compliant with UEFI) in Win 8.  Solutions are apparently  1) disable Secure Boot in my PC's BIOS or 2) contact MSI and have them provide an updated BIOS.  I did the latter and MSI promised to provide an updated BIOS that would allow the 7730 to work with Secure Boot in Win 8.  I am waiting and if I am able to correct this problem with the MSI solution I'll update my review, but not until.  Update 7 Jan 2014:  OK, so here's the deal.  After working on the installation of my card half of the day I've finally got it up and running and working great with my two monitor system.  So how did it get there you ask???  When I originally installed the MSI 7730 in late December my computer had beeped several times and there was no video on either of the two monitors that I used.  I had not a clue what the problem was so I went to the internet and the beeps suggested it may be a number of problems to include an insufficient power supply (I was already upgrading that from HP's puny 300W to a 500W Corsair), a bad GPU (unlikely but possible), a bad motherboard (even less likely in my experience) or Secure Boot enabled (a logical and most probable reason based on information from the internet).  Turns out it was the fact that Secure Boot was enabled on my Win 8 system and MSI had not updated the 7730 to be compatible with Win 8 and Secure Boot enabled(shame on them).  I contacted MSI and they assured me they would email a firmware update to me to correct the problem, but I got tired of waiting for them to send it.  I also had found a document on the HP web site titled &#34;Computer Does Not Start After Installing a New Video Card (Windows 8)&#34; that provided instructions for disabling Secure Boot (and at the same time you have to enable LegacyBoot).  I also found a neat YouTube video that showed the process step by step - it is really easy.  So what I did was disabled Secure Boot and enabled Legacy Boot.  Unfortunately, when I turned my system on only one of my two monitors (the LG E2742 cabled HDMI one) came on but the HG 2009m monitor cabeled DVI was dark.  Darn - now what??  Well I know it has to be the MSI 7730 card not sending a proper signal to the monitor because I know the monitor is good.  So I reasoned that if MSI was lax enough not to provide the most up to date firmware for their card maybe the driver for the card was out of date as well.  So I went to the AMD website and downloaded the most up to date driver for the 7730 GPU (it was Dec 18, 2013), installed it, and bingo my second monitor had video :-)  But then I looked at my main monitor (the 27&#34; LG E2742) and darn there was 1&#34; black border all around the image.  I went to Display in Control Panel and the LG monitor was set at the correct resolution so back to the internet I went.  One of the forums I read suggested checking and adjusting the &#34;monitor scaling&#34; setting in the GPU software (they suggested it should be at &#34;0% overscan&#34;) to get rid of the black border.  I opened the &#34;AMD Catalyst Control Center&#34; software on my computer related to my MSI 7730 GPU, and sure enough after looking through several menus I found a &#34;Desktops and Displays&#34; with a &#34;More&#34; selection that led to a &#34;My Digital Flat-Panels&#34; section with a &#34;Scaling Options&#34; sections.  Lo and behold when I opened it up there was overscan, I set it to 0%, and both monitors now work perfectly.  So I'm only increasing my rating one star to three because of all of the problems I had and the lousy installation documentation provided with the MSI 7730 card.  If I didn't have almost 30 years of computer experience, I'd maybe never have figured this one out, no thanks to MSI.  Thanks however to HP and all of those greatfolks on the internet for suggestions that led to a solution. Incidentally the con of disabling Secure Boot is that apparently hard disks larger than 2TB would not not be recognized by my system, but because I don't intend to install anything larger than 2TB on my system that is not a problem. Good luck with your installation if you get one of these.  Update 31 Jan 2016:  MSI never did supply me with an updated BIOS so this card build would be compatible with Win 8 (shame on them) so I reduced stars to two.  After my original difficult and convoluted installation, I've had no other problems with the card.	2014-01-01

I did not install it because a) The TV didn't need to be that high for the height of my couch, and b) I didn't want to have extra shelf space to keep clean from dust.  The packaging came with black plastic caps that I put in holes where the top shelf would have gone.  I can't even see the plastic caps if I'm sitting at the couch watching TV.<br /><br />I only wish South Shore made other living room furniture to match.

Crain (The pattern has changed)  ----------------------    Samantha Crain is a fictional writer turned singer-songwriter from Oklahoma. This is her third LP (plus an EP) and it's an Alt-country/Americana/Indie-rock hybrid. My impression is that country and folk seem to be where her \\"natural\\" tendencies lie. Instrumentally and vocally, her previous works are very, very catchy -She understands well how to craft a powerful hook! On 'Kid Face', the instrumental composition strives for a warm and endearingly melodic informing of the narrative. The LP's overarching frame of mind is one of thoughtful considerations as well as true-to-everyday-life sincerity and \\"sensibility\\" rather than the predictable singer-songwriter fare of cataloging life's disappointments followed briskly by a floral monologue of indignation and/or melancholy. That she somehow maintains her disposition toward thoughtfulness and sincerity, despite doing a fair amount of \\"cataloging\\" herself, is as welcomed as it is innovative.    S. Crain harbors the \\"proper\\" writer's tendency to (1) frames lyrics as stories and (2) paint a contextual portrait. She has commented on how this is largely an autobiographic work though she isn't always the center of attention or does she spend all her time musing about the catastrophes of life. Everyday themes, but more importantly everyday imagery, abound. She's even homespun (that I say to flatter) when she does speak directly to her anguish. Track 5's lyrics bear this out, \\"Cleaning the sink because I can't think of nothing to do/I'm going to shows and counting my toes and crying over you\\". The LP's most common themes are of wandering and searching -literally, allegorically, personally and interpersonally. She is also found of phrasing questions. It seems that no matter what she is going on about, Ms. Crain's lyric's have an easily discernable trajectory of reflection, reconciliation, and maturation. It's as if she is using the experiences of self to work through to the other side of self. The net result of all this is that she never becomes mired in the mud of self-without-end. She's just trying to find her way and, as she makes this clear on a few tracks, hopes that others in her life will find their way as well -Lot's of good vibes all around. In my opinion, the Neil Young'ish track 4 is this LP's confluence-moment for all her many gifts and tendencies. Long story short, this LP is a tale of how modest and articulate folks from Oklahoma go about achieving insight and, I sincerely hope, peace.	2013-02-26

Earth's Design Pure White Mulberry Leaf Tea- Premium ... has a warning on the back  ... the warning that I guess should have been on the tea bags link, and also mentioned by Dr. Oz, esp., that the product on the website claims this to be the exact product shown on his show:<br />&#34;Cautions: This supplement may increase the effects of blood-sugar lowering medications (e.g. insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents) and side-effects of cholesterol-lowering medications. Those taking prescription anti-depressants and sedatives should use with caution and first seek the advice of a physician. Avoid use if pregnant, lactating or with known hypersensitivity to white mulberry.&#34;<br />  I bought this leaf tea because it says it's 'white' ... the less expensive mulberry tea bags I first ordered (Sunrise Pure Nutrition - Pure White Mulberry Tea - &#34;as seen on Dr. Oz&#34;) have all black tea in them, been staining my teeth, thought this 'white' version wouldn't do that, probably will - it has a few white twigs, the rest are dark colors. :( - If this tea really does what it claims, and really is the &#34;next superfood&#34; Dr. Oz claims, it's worth taking if one is not on any of the above meds. But, we need these warnings to be part of the selling process. I have very high cholesteral and glucose numbers but can't tolerate the drugs, making this product 'too good to be true' - but worth trying, for me. Maybe someone can ease our minds on this and refute the warnings?	2014-02-21

US	16544116	R1ODWK6DNYBDBA	B00FM2AMAE	726152063	LaView 4 Camera Security System, D1 RealTime 4 Channel DVR w/500GB HDD and 4 Bullet 600TVL Day and Night Indoor/Outdoor Surveillance Kit	Camera	5	31	33	N	N	Great for the Price!	I got the 4 Channel DVR system during a Lightning Deal for $135 in Dec 2014. It was easy to hook up, I ran the wires under my house in the crawl space and up through my master bedroom floor to the DVR. I placed 3 cameras outside and one camera inside in the living room. The wires were all long enough to reach all of the locations. I also hooked up remote viewing with an ethernet wire to my router upstairs. Set up was pretty easy with the youtube videos. I set up cameras to only record motion, and I can still go back about 2 months and it hasn't been recorded over yet. The only problem I had was one camera had very bad reception during the night right out of the box. The screen was fuzzy with horizontal lines, which caused the DVR to detect motion throughout the night. I contacted Laview, they replied by email and wanted a screenshot of the problem camera. I emailed them back, and they immediately emailed a return label to send back the camera free of charge. They sent a new camera and it worked great. The DVR playback and search feature is simple and easy to use. It could be a little easier to search, but it does the job. Remote view worked perfectly on my macbook and also on my iPhone app, but it would only work if I was connected to my home internet. It wouldn't work if I was at work or away from home. I contacted Laview, and they emailed me back immediately and helped me correct the problem. Night vision isn't that great unless the object is close or if you have exterior lights on during the night. Our indoor camera makes a loud clicking noise when watching tv after dark as it switches from night vision to regular, so this gets very annoying. I wish I would have put all cameras outside due to this, but I just pull the power cord in the closet when we are in the living room any evening. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this system for the price I paid! It gives me great piece of mind knowing my house is under surveillance. Someone stole a flower pot off my brick mailbox and we also had a package that was marked as delivered but we never received it in the past, so now having cameras and DVR will help if anything like that ever happens again. Recommend! I attached a screenshot of the 4 camera views, and also a screenshot of the bad camera that Laview replaced.	2015-03-12

I really like that watch, but replacing the battery would be somewhat expensive, so I looked for a batteryless (solar) Timex, but could not find one. I saw this one, but hesitated because I seemed to remember from a previous watch a long time ago that the Casio menus were not intuitive, and overall the watch seemed cheap.<br /><br />Well, assuming I remembered correctly, Casio has IMPROVED dramatically. I love this watch. The menus are very intuitive, and the overall quality is great, especially given the low price ($29). I can read the numbers very easily. I love that it uses a capacitor instead of a battery (which can lose its ability to hold a charge, just like your cell phone). I keep it in the sunlight by a window when I'm not using it, and haven't had any problem with it losing its charge (haven't pushed this aspect). I also like how thin it is (even though I'm a guy, I don't like a big gaudy watch), even thinner than my Timex. As others have said, it doesn't have a backlight, but I almost never used that on my Timex, so won't miss that. Overall, I'm very satisfied.	2014-05-13

Not a review, really, because I am shopping. I must eat all organic, so I know the drill. I'm puzzled. Organ's \\"Strawberries and Cream\\" is organic, but contains no strawberries. At least they are not listed in either the ingredients or the allergy information. It does list \\"Organic Natural Flavors\\" in the ingredients list. If that means it contains some form of strawberries, it would be helpful to know, because some people are allergic to strawberries. It would be great if those people could enjoy the strawberry flavor without being exposed to strawberries. But, if the only strawberries are the ones on the package, and its organic, so there are no chemicals that taste like strawberries, why and how does this shake taste like strawberries?  Just askin'....<br /><br />Various folks are critical of the product because it is not what they want it to be--a protein shake, for example. If you read the suggested uses in the advertising, you'll see that this is a multi-purpose drink. I wouldn't give something a low rating because it is not what I was looking for, or I didn't shop very well and made a purchase that turned out to be not what I wanted. It is not the product's fault. If it is terrible or delightful, that's one thing. But if its not what you want, rather than being critical, you could write a review to bring something to readers' attention, or, better yet, contact the manufacturers and let them know how they could best serve your needs or desires.<br /><br />BTW, a star rating is required to submit a review. I gave it 4 stars only because I have this question about the contents and labeling of the shake.	2013-07-21

US	33900984	R3EARJBCZBQ0S6	B000PHQEOO	700474446	Aluratek 7-Inch Digital Photo Frame with 256MB (Black)	Camera	3	4	4	N	Y	Good but not Great	I researched a very long time trying to find a digital frame that would do all the things I wanted without costing me an arm and leg.  This frame looks really nice and classy.  It cannot be mounted to the wall but can be put up on its stand.  Frame itself seems sturdy wood/plastic and plastic stand can be rotated for vertical or horizontal viewing.  I cannot remark about the video or music capabilities as I am not using this frame for anything but pictures.      Pros:    Nice display area.  Very easy set up.  Compact and easy remote.  Can load A LOT of pictures if jpeg is saved at smallest file size.  Brightness/Contrast/Color can be adjusted.  Can play many kinds of memory cards.  Can be set up to turn off and on with timer.  Picture transitions has several settings.  Slideshow changes has 3 settings for how long a picture will be displayed.  Comes with USB cable to download pictures from PC computer.  Easy load and removal of pictures.  I called the company with a few questions and the tech was very helpful and accommodating.    Cons:    Display/picture can't be seen well at all angles.  You really have to view it dead on to see the picture at its best.  Picture order can't be changed.  Whatever the file name is is how the frame will play it.  The manual has a section \\"Adjust Order or Pictures in Slideshow\\", but this does NOT mean changing the order of play for the physical pictures.  It refers to the transition of the pictures while displaying.  Does not have an on/off button on the frame.  Must be powered off by the remote or unplugged.  Has 256k internal memory on board.  Media storage/playback is one or the other, not combined, so pictures will not play from internal memory AND a flash drive or memory card at the same time.  The instruction manual is a little vague.  Clock shows in set up that it can be set for 12 or 24 hour, but can only really be set as 24 for some reason.    Out of the box I'm having a problem with the power on of the frame.  The screen sometimes boots up blurry and I have to turn it off and on again a few times before the screen shows clear.  Overall I am happy with the frame.  I wish the display/pictures could be viewed from more angles and that the pictures could be organized and played in a different sequence.  I would recommend this product though.	2008-02-07
US	47350951	R31RXQFZEKEAV7	B000NK6DZI	379672599	Canon PowerShot TX1 7.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom	Camera	5	5	5	N	N	Great all around family video/photo camera	I was sooo tired of hauling around a digital snapshot camera and a camcorder. I've got 4 kids and we do all the normal stuff. Soccer, skiing, Disneyland etc. etc. Have you ever skied a full day with a camcorder hanging around your neck? Almost as much fun as trudging through Disneyland for a day with one of those things around your neck.    So I heard about these \\"dual purpose\\" camcorders that record onto a memory card. I read all the reviews I could find. But let me tell you, don't believe these guys who pooh pooh this camcorder because the images aren't sharp enough or they're not \\"true\\" HD, or they use some unconventional file format. If you care about that stuff, then go spend the $3000 to get that stuff. But if you want a pocket sized camcorder to haul around to the family outings, buy this. Still images are excellent. There's plenty of pre-programmed settings (snow, beach, portrait etc.), so you'll always be ready to go. And the video quality is unbelievable coming from this little thing. I got an 8 Gig card and I've never run out of space. I plugged it into my Mac and it worked without a hitch or any messing around with settings, cords, connections etc. Pure plug and play with iPhoto. iMovie imports the movies from iPhoto. The Canon software isn't bad either, but I seldom use it.    The ergonomics do take some getting used to. The shutter button is at the top of the box and it's a little tricky on the first few uses to keep the rest of your fingers out of the frame. The thumb controls on the back for the camcorder can also be tricky to get the hang of. But after a few uses, I got used to it and it feels great now. Be careful asking strangers to use it though because it's not your typical button layout for either a camera or a camcorder.    This is the best $400 I've spent in a long time. Replaced both a digital camera and a camcorder. And it's saved my neck, back and sanity on all those family outings I enjoy shooting.	2008-04-06

I'll add to it as I try new things. I still have to try the loose-leaf Jasmine and the blooming teas. The stars in the review will be an average of these mini reviews.<br /><br />I'm a Tea Ambassador for Tea Beyond, so I received free samples.<br /><br />Earl Grey -- 2 Stars<br />I was disappointed because it's not Earl Grey. It's black tea with lemon peel. Tea Beyond wanted a natural Earl Grey. When a suitable one couldn't be found, the company opted to use lemon. Noble reason, but don't call it \\"Earl Grey.\\"  Earl Grey is my favorite tea, so I have high expectations.<br /><br />The lemon is very subtle. The malty note is less so. This is a full-bodied black tea and very smooth. The quality is amazing. I've never seen a black tea with such long, full leaves. The large chunks of lemon peel are unmistakable.<br /><br />Caramel Black Tea -- 1 star<br />I am on a quest to find a great caramel black tea. This is not it. I didn't taste any caramel and found the tea to be bitter. I shared a sample with another tea enthusiast who had the same experience. I wrote back to share my opinion and ask if perhaps my samples had been labeled incorrectly.  Below are excerpts from the exchange.  I was encouraged to share my negative opinion because it provides a different perspective.<br /><br />Me<br />\\"I tried the caramel tea this morning and I am really disappointed.  Before I write my review, I wanted to ask a few questions.

I decided to switch up my Pizza Casserole recipe and use the Casarecce noodles instead of egg noodles . It turned out GREAT ! My very picky kids had seconds . The Shape of the Casarecce noodles allowed for extra sauce to seep into them , which made for extra flavor in each bite . The noodles are pretty thick so you don't need as much as you would a smaller noodle . I will definitely be cooking with the Casarecce noodles more often .	2015-02-05

I am very grateful to all the other reviewers because without their reviews, I would not have taken a chance and bought this.

But, the way that necklace is displayed gives a much clearer picture of what this necklace really looks like. Because of the way this is displayed in this picture, I was hesitant to purchase it.<br /><br />The toggle closure is very good. The necklace lays nicely and it is a brighter red than you see here. I bought the bracelet that goes very nicely with it.Try it, I feel you won't get anything similar for this price and apparent quality!	2012-04-06

I've been using Norton SystemWorks Basic for many years and have been very happy with the way it functions on Windows XP.  After reading other reviews, I decided to first delete my old SystemWorks 2006 before attempting the installation of the new CD SystemWorks Standard Edition, v11.<br /><br />About 2/3 of the way through the deletion, I got an error message saying that the deletion was aborted.  This was time consuming, and unfortunately predictable.  The Error message directed me to the Symantec Website to download their Uninstall Tool.  Deletion of the old program using this Symantec Uninstall Tool then went very smoothly.  I agree with the disappointment expressed by a previous reviewer.  Symantec should make this product to include an Uninstall Tool on the CD, or better yet have an automatic uninstall of previous versions as a part of the new installation process.<br /><br />The good news is that the installation of both the new SystemWorks and the Antivirus programs went without a hitch and they are working great.  These two segments have been separated in the new software installation, resulting in their own separate desktop icons.  This separation surprised me, but they do the job.  I am very happy with this newest version of SystemWorks.  The Standard Version also catches and removes spyware and adware.  I'd give 5 stars for the functioning of Systemworks Standard Edition, v.11, but give only 3 stars for the problems related to deletion and installation.  Overall, I'm awarding four stars to this product.	2008-01-22

The hinges for the top storage compartments have turned out to be sturdy, no problem at all. (That was one of my original concerns, as they are attached with very small screws.) Overall the table still looks and works great. The only negative after 11 months of use: the corners underneath the overhanging sides are sharp! Rounding these off slightly would have saved a few painful bumps.  * Original review:  The design and size of the table are nice. The materials feel like an upgrade over most Ikea-type furniture, though the construction and assembly methods are similar. The hinged top doors fit surprisingly well, and the storage areas they conceal quite large -- an oversized micro fleece blanket fits easily in one side, for example.  Overall we're happy with this table. We'll see how it holds up over an extended period of time in a home with two children.  A few notes on assembly: Assembly does take some time and effort. Expect assembly to take at least 90 minutes if you're somewhat handy and/or experienced with this sort of thing. If you are not already familiar with assembling flat-pack furniture (think: Ikea), you may want to budget 2 hours or more. The instructions are mostly clear and easy to follow, though some guidance on how far down to screw some of the locking pins would have helped. Assembly can be done alone, but attaching the hinged top surfaces is much easier with two persons.  I do have some concerns about how well the hinges for the top storage compartments will hold up over time. The small screws used to attach the hinges to the top surfaces didn't seem to fit tightly enough or really grip into the wood as snugly as I would have liked. I may take them out and add a few drops of glue before reseating them.	2014-09-07

Wow!  I love this DVR!  I hooked this up to a spare Ethernet port on my router, and an open HDMI port on my A/V receiver, and an old rooftop antenna, and within an hour, it had updated its software via the internet, and scanned all of the local digital channels available in my area, for a total of 78 free channels!<br />The TiVo Guide is wonderful!  I didn't realize how many free OTA digital broadcasts are available in the metroplex, including ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, PBS, CW, MeTV, ION Television, along with 70 other free channels!<br />This TiVo Roamio has OnePass Manager to help you record a tv series, even those that are on summer hiatus, or any new shows scheduled to be broadcast beyond the 2-week Guide!  Last night, I scheduled the new NBC series Blindspot to record, even though the first broadcast doesn't air until September 21, a month from now!  My AT&T's U-verse DVR, which I loved, could not do this!  U-verse would let you record new shows only when they became visible in the 2-week Guide, but not until then.  Tivo is grabbing the future broadcast info from the television network websites, apparently.<br />The quality of the locally broadcast HD channels are amazing!  Last night we recorded the CBS Nightly News with Scott Pelley, and played it back in full 1080p HD and 5.1 stereo, via my Yamaha A/V receiver, connected via an HDMI cable.  I had forgotten how pristine the local HD broadcasts really are!<br />And, the Amazon Instant Video interface is much nicer on Tivo Roamio than on my Roku, which I still use for watching Sling TV for shows that aren't locally broadcast.<br />With my new TiVo Roamio OTA DVR, along with Roku, Sling TV, and Amazon Instant Videos, I am saving about $1,000 a year, after saying goodbye to AT&T U-verse, which I loved for many years, and still have access to tons of shows and movies!  Thank you Amazon!	2015-08-27

Please, read labels when buying this product, as there are many out there with fillers and chemicals which have no place in coconut milk. There will be a bit of thickener (Guar gum, as a rule), but nothing else should be there.<br /><br />Second, this product is very versatile. It can be used in soups, sauces, salad dressings and deserts. One of my favorite uses is to make a chocolate dipping sauce with cocoa and stevia - Diabetics and low carb eaters - this is WONDERFUL for fruit. It has great flavor, although very mild, and does not dominate other flavors when used in recipes. Yummy!<br /><br />You may find it has \\"separated\\" slightly when you open it. This is normal, just stir and use. I put mine in a glass storage container if I need to do this, as it is easier to stir in something other than the can.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2012-09-04

I was really looking forward to enjoying all the packettes of drink. I have high blood pressure and imagine my dismay when I discovered the Strawberry (which I was very much anticipating) was an \\"energy\\" drink with caffiene added. I had always relied upon Crystal Light because I did not have to worry about getting ingredients which would be harmful to my health, however if I had not noticed the caffiene in the packettes and drank them my blood pressure would have shot up and I could have had ill effects from it. I threw all the Strawberry packettes in the trash so I did not feel I got the value that I paid for because in the discription there was nothing about caffiene.	2012-09-13

Previous to subscribing to DeCecco spaghetti, I was in the habit of hunting down cases of Giuseppe Cocco spaghetti, and frankly, paying too much. Free freight was hard to come by.  Then one day as I leafed through a copy of Cook's magazine, I noticed an article that discussed and rated brands of pasta. Although my favorite  Giuseppe Cocco pasta wasn't rated, the editors chose DeCecco as their all-around favorite, and one of the reasons was that it was made in a more time-intensive way with a coarser ground semolina flour for a better product.  I thought I'd give it another try. My attitude had been that it was overpriced and often picked up a cardboard flavor from the packaging, especially if stored for awhile. I was pleasantly surprised by my first shipment. The boxes are better quality now and don't give off a taste to the product. The spaghetti cooks up very well--good flavor, nice springy \\"chew,\\" good window of time for al dente doneness, doesn't break apart. At the subscription price of $2/lb, it's very close in quality to Giuseppe Cocco which is about $6-7/lb, so I'm quite happy with my subscription, but five pounds a month runs out too fast. How about seven or eight pounds a month?	2012-09-21

I had to quit eating the other \\"British\\" milk chocolate bar from the big box store because it was causing me indigestion - I don't know what ingredient caused the indigestion but after learning that this \\"British\\" product is made by a U.S. company I figured I could take my pick of substandard ingredients. This Green&Black's Organic Milk Chocolate Bar with Almonds, on the other hand, causes no indigestion and is in every other way simply sublime.<br /><br />Why is this bar a great value?

This iced tea is delicious, and as canned beverages go it is much healthier than whatever else is out there.  I am a holistic cardiologist and drink a half can of this daily.  It does contain sugar, but in fairly modest amounts for this type of beverage.  I believe people should eat real food, even diabetics.  Sugar as a food is not bad in modest amounts though artificial sweeteners are very bad for everyone, so if you'd like your beverage to be a little sweet, it should contain a natural sweetener (like sugar, honey, etc.) as this one does.  Also, this is green tea which is especially healthy for us.  And ignore the person who says this drink is a problem for people with an acid stomach.  The healthy human stomach is very acidic (pH of 1-4), and the lemon juice in this beverage won't make a dent on the pH.  His recommendation to take an antacid when he drinks this is too off-base to even comment on and indicates how little he knows about human physiology and also how unhealthy doing that is for him.  Enjoy this beverage in modest amounts as part of a healthy diet, just as I have for years.	2015-03-10

The appearance wasn’t the best: the bar looked kind of like smooth cardboard with a few red flecks. Also, it was a smaller than what I expected: instead of a large rectangular, it looked more like a square that had been slightly stretched on the ends. Appearance aside, INBAR CINNAMON SWIRL is a somewhat bland protein bar. Initially there isn’t much taste, but after eating a few bites you get an aftertaste of cinnamon. It’s flavored with agave, so is sweet, but not sugary and is high in protein and fiber. It’s gluten & allergen-free, 100% GMO-free, Kosher, and 100% vegan. I enjoyed this INBAR  CINNAMON SWIRL bar. It’s not as good as the INBAR STRAWBERRY BANANA FLAVOR bar, but it does fill you up and helps ward off hunger cravings.

As others have already said, if you're a fan of Shriekback - be it casual or rabid - the purchase of this album is an absolute no-brainer.  But for those who may be new to the band, you will not be disappointed.  Even though Shriekback has been making music since the 80s, they show no sign of being tired or worn out.  Quite the reverse, in fact: free of any external meddling or influence (i.e. big record label execs), the Shrieks have been delivering some of the best work of their long careers this past decade, and &#34;Without Real String or Fish&#34; continues this fine trend.  The music is smart.  It is clever.  It is funny.  You will need a dictionary while reading their lyrics.<br /><br />The music is rewarding too.  This is not an &#34;empty calories&#34; kind of band that delivers a hit song which burns out in a couple of months (I mean, really, who still listens to &#34;Gangnam Style&#34; any more?).  Shriekback's music is long-lasting.  Any Shriekback fan will tell you that they are still discovering new meanings and new depths to even the earliest songs from the 80s, and that the more you listen to the Shrieks, the more irresistible it all becomes.<br /><br />So why not download a few tracks from Amazon and give them a spin?  Better yet, head over to Shriekback's website and order yourself a full CD, complete with lyric booklet.  Your body will thank you for the dance-inducing rhythms, while your mind and musical soul will thank you for transporting them down this magical path.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2015-05-01

I grew up with them, and they've been my favorite for decades. I'm sure that the formulation has changed over time as ingredient costs and sources change. But generally, Cheerios now, taste much like I remember them tasting for a long time.<br /><br />I like them. This package can be a good deal on sale. Aside from that there's not a lot to explain about Cheerios you probably don't already know. There are four normal boxes and everything arrived safely packaged and in good shape.<br /><br />The thing is, I like other O-shaped oat cereals better. I've eaten a lot of different versions of a Cheerio, and find that Trader Joe's O's just come out ahead, even when they're a little more expensive (usually only $2 a box though). They taste better than GM Cheerios, they don't tear up the roof of my mouth, they're just all around better.<br /><br />I'll buy these on sale occasionally if I don't want to make the trip to the nearest Trader Joe's (kind of far) and they do the trick for a while. But they're just not the champs anymore.	2013-03-24

[[VIDEOID:2419e2d8e7ca3d2628a87b859c741ff3]]This is a gorgeous dark colored sandelwood watch that is lightweight and incredibly unique. It is hypoallergenic so can be worn by anyone allergic to metals, etc. The watch is not adjustable out of the box, but links can be removed to just the right fit for you. Because of it being a natural wood the watch you will get may look slightly different than the one you see on the product page or on my video.  Each watch will look uniquely beautiful.<br /><br />I am thrilled that I received a complimentary sample of this watch in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I was disappointed in the shoulder mount because it rotates forward and back, but not side to side.  The shoulder mount needs a gimbal to correct for the fact that no one has shoulders that are level.  There may be a way to take the gimbal from the bike mount and connect it, but I have not figured it out yet.  I have not seen anyone else have a shoulder mount, so this still allows for something no one else provides (there are chest mounts available).<br />I used the for a Grand Canyon raft trip, worked great.  I took the shoulder mount and attached it to a dry bag - worked great, I received great footage.	2015-08-12

No leakage around the edges of the screen.  Blacks are really black - no light at all.  Absolutely no visible motion blur.  The network features work very well - the internet browser currently does not support Flash which is a shame, but that will probably change eventually.    I use the TV mostly to show HD videos from my PC and it manages that very well, either with the DLNA capabilities or with its Plex media server.  I have seldom seen any hesitation with screen updates over the wireless network except with lots of action on the screen and 720P or 1080i HD programs.  In these cases make sure nothing else on your wireless network is using any bandwidth because you will need everything that Wireless G can provide.  The 3D works, but I think it is still a novelty - no material to watch out there yet.  Make sure you get the right glasses, it will only work with the AG-S250.  The wand remote control is usually great, but sometimes seems to wander on its own.  Not sure what the issue is with this, but on the whole I'd rather have the wand than navigate with a conventional remote.  It's like using a mouse to navigate a computer screen.  In summary, a highly superior TV for those who want top class performance, and notice the difference.	2011-12-21

First, with this newer type of devise, the processer speed need to improve, along with the load speed. WD should consider  putting in a faster memory read function in their unit, along with much faster processors. On the flip side, the unit is very good at what it does. It picks up the router signal well, and for short and long videos, it does well with pretty much glitch-free function. One reason I purchase WDTV unit of ROKU is the availability of YouTube built in in the primary menu, and the fact that is can work with my home network for viewing saved other media (video, pictures, music) and my other computers can use its functionality (this is somewhat limited until I can figure out how to work this out more). This with the usable USB port for playing stored media, all these features make the WD TV media box a good choice as a media player.	2012-05-24

The interface is much better (I  also heard that Cable TV is suing Tivo for stealing their interface).  Anyways I'm definately getting a Replay. My question is which would be  better.

I have had this recorder for one month, and have had very few problems. Out of 20 recorded discs, only one has been corrupted. The discs exhibit strong compatibility with my other players.  The quality of the recordings is outstanding relative to the source, even in 3-hour mode (LP). I have no use for the higher capacity modes, and have yet to try them. Contrary to many reviews, the manual is easy to follow, succinct, and methodical in its instructional format. However, if you plan on archiving safety copies of copy-protected DVDs or transferring prerecorded VHS onto DVD, make sure you have some sort of device to defeat copy-protection. For VHS, it's not that difficult, but DVDs are tougher. Amazon probably would not it if I told you how. However, it can be done!	2003-04-29

The Squeezebox solved two big problems: signal quality and content.  <br /> <br />I live in a difficult reception area. On a bad day the local classical music station can sound like Radio Free Mars. That stations' internet stream sounds great running through the Squeezebox. I can finally use the good living room speakers to do more than play CD's and phonographs. The Squeezebox does not reproduce music in CD quality but the apples to apples comparison should be with FM not CD, right? Perhaps the folks with golden ears will be unhappy, but for me the sound is just fine.  <br /> <br />The other problem was the musical content provided by the local station. It has recently been going the wrong way: thin play list, commercial, happy talk, another commercial. I listened because it was the only game in town. No more. There are some great classical music stations streaming their signals -- WFMT, KUSC, KCPE, WABE, and WNYC. They are all now available by clicking a remote. <br /> <br />This thing put radio back in my life. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-30

Folds down for storage in your camera bag or light bag.<br /><br />I used to shoot for a local newspaper and had the older version of this product. I used it many times per day and it always got the white balance dead on and with the focus mark in the center, allows you to leave auto focus turned on while using. I usually use a light meter, but in a pinch this can be used to set exposure with the in camera metering as well (if your using a camera with excellent accurate metering built in).  It lasted for over 10 years, until I lost it, so now someone else has a great product.<br /><br />I purchased this one to replace my previous model and am even more impressed with this one.This model has the focus marks on the gray side and the white side and is the prefect size to use and fold up for carry in your bag. I have always found if you set your white balance and exposure correctly there is no need to shoot raw images, jpg image work great and are much smaller storage space wise and blow up to billboard size with no problem if you are using the right camera and optics.<br /><br />This is a must have for anyone wanting a compact and well build product (instead of carrying gray cards) to set their white balance correctly and if you do not have access to or cannot afford a good light meter, can also be used to set exposure. My suggestion, unless your outdoors in sunlight, always, always, always set white balance manually with this or another gray card product. Do not every rely on the in camera white balance other than outdoor sunlight if you want correct colors in your images.	2014-02-02

Chuck Berry gave it to Keith Richards relentlessly both during the rehearsels for this concert and all throughout the show in St Louis that night!  And all because Keith had dared him to put on a real show for once with a real band, and not just use some local talent as has been his usuall practice, throughout his entire career.  <BR>   The lapses in guitar solos during the St Louis concert proves it as there there because of Berry's messing with the arrangements, (not playing as rehearsed)!  To Mr.Richards credit the thing turned in to a night of rock n roll magic regardless, and a bit of rock history any lover of the craft would surely love to own.<BR>   Mr.Berry found himself in more legal hot water some time after this film was made and one still has to wonder if in fact K.Richards might know more about that then he'll ever let on?

What I like about this one is the somewhat stiff performances by Shaq and Anfernee Hardaway, which add \\"something\\" of reality to the film.  Really.  The other good thing is Nick Nolte.  He played his part to the hilt.  He sold his soul to the devil (he cheated), but then he redeemed himself.  The scene with him teaching the kids at the playground the fundamentals is a classy and classic ending.  Excellent movie. It's not as emotionally exhilerating as Hoosiers, but that's another story, right?	2003-02-05

Looks nice - doesn't look like plastic (supposedly Mother of Pearl - all 3 colors - pink, white and yellow) and then the hanging pearl.  There's a sterling silver backing on which the pieces are attached - must be with glue? (can't see how it's affixed) and there was also one very small clasp-like swirl on the front right side, which seems to help hold the large pink flower and the 2 small flowers together.  The 2 small flowers are set into the metal piece.  There are small rhinestones or crystals within each of the 2 small flowers on the side and one crystal in a setting between the 2 small flowers. The pearl moves.<br /><br />Ironically, it is longer than the indicated (18mm = .70866 inches) at almost 1.5 inches long (!!) the entire design, not including the jump ring.  But it also indicates that the width is the same 18mm - must be width of largest pink flower? (See review for the earrings - they were much shorter than advertised).  It is light weight but think will lay nice.  (It's for my wedding, cream dress with black train/trim with cream colored embroidered flowers/swirls.  Couldn't find affordable black stones with pearls.)<br /><br />I have no concept as respects price and value, though.  It was originally 49 and marked down to 34.50)  Think it's sweet overall.	2013-05-20

Amazon apparently does not offer this company's ware -- boxes of fine foods from different locations around the world. Based on the Paris and the Morocco boxes that I have received, Try the World is an excellent source of interesting foods, and something of a cultural travelogue writer to boot -- highly recommended for both.<br /><br />I was totally unprepared for the enthusiasm a new and very close friend expressed on the telephone yesterday. She was born and raised near Paris, is a superb home cook, and has exquisite sense of taste, especially for French foods. As well as I can remember, she said:<br /><br />&#34;This is wonderful salt.<br /><br />&#34;It doesn't taste like salt.<br /><br />&#34;It's unlike any other salt.<br /><br />&#34;It has a slight taste of the sea, of seaweed, of algae -- not aggressive.<br /><br />&#34;Just a small pinch. The food  explodes&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;It doesn't stick together like other salts.<br /><br />&#34;Much less makes the food taste better -- often this salt is all I need. So I may not use other condiments or herbs.<br /><br />&#34;Not sure about delicate vegetables.<br /><br />&#34;But on hearty vegetables and fish, just superb.&#34;<br /><br />Now, after 42 years of marriage with one woman, and four years of a close relationship with another, I've learned one thing.<br /><br />If she is happy, I am very happy.<br /><br />Bring on Le Saunier De Camargue Fleur de Sel!<br /><br />Robert C,.

The improvement in sound quality is stunning. I've spent the day playing everything from classic jazz to live rock to production-heavy digital recordings. The sound delivers on every level.    A couple things that non-audio-techs should probably know before purchasing this: 1. \\"STREAMER\\" DOESN'T MEAN IT STREAMS MUSIC. 2. YOU WILL LOSE KEYBOARD AND REMOTE CONTROL OF YOUR COMPUTER SOUND. 3. THE SOUND IMPROVEMENT PROBABLY OUTWEIGHS THESE ISSUES.    Details below:    1. \\"STREAMER\\" DOESN'T MEAN IT STREAMS MUSIC. Smart audio-tech people will laugh at this, but Average Joes like me will make a false assumption. These days, when you hear the word \\"streaming\\" in correlation with music or video, you think of something online, wireless. I actually thought I was buying something that I could hook to my computer and, separately, to my receiver/speakers, so I could STREAM music. Not so.      My assumption was based on the name of the product, and on the very basic installation instructions: \\"Just plug the Music Streamer II into any USB port on your computer ... Connect the other end into any analog input... and you are ready to STREAM high quality computer-based music...\\" I thought the \\"other end\\" was a receptor of some sort that would receive the streamed music.    In reality, this is a wired device. It connects between the USB on your computer and the analog input wire on your speakers.    2. YOU WILL LOSE KEYBOARD AND REMOTE CONTROL OF YOUR COMPUTER SOUND. The Music Streamer II installs automatically, which is very good. The surprise for me was that I could no longer tap the volume control on my Mac keyboard if I needed to turn it down (or up). Sound volume now can only be controlled manually at the speakers, or (in my case) from within the iTunes app. So the remote control for the computer is now useless, and that cool ability to tap the keyboard to lower volume is now gone. There are workarounds, like using the Remote app on the iPhone or just muting the whole computer from the keyboard, but this unexpected hassle did throw a wet blanket on the Mac coolness factor.    3. THE SOUND IMPROVEMENT PROBABLY OUTWEIGHS THESE ISSUES. Knowing the above two things ahead of time may have affected my decision to purchase this component. But finding out about them as I discovered the sound improvement, I am inclined to keep the Music Streamer II. After one day of testing, my analysis is the sound improvement is worth the inconvenience. We'll see if my family agrees in practical, day-to-day usage. A lot can be said for the ability to simply tap-tap-tap a central keyboard in order to hear something important while still hearing the music: Basic usability should never be underestimated.	2011-05-05

Having the backslope has it's pluses and minuses - good for rack mounted equipment, but if you're putting a shelf in, a few washers to shim to make the shelf sit level are necessary.  I used a  machine bolt nut with an ID larger than the rack screws, and my Odyssey shelf is perfectly level, mounted reverse (facing out like a desk).

I recently ordered 5 different ukulele models while researching products for my senior adult choir at church as I wanted to give them a few options.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00AEY9MZG Okina UK100 Soprano Ukulele with Rosewood Fingerboard - Natural]]<br />[[ASIN:B008277N80 Diamond Head DU-150 Ukulele, Natural]]<br />[[ASIN:B001SN7R6I Mahalo U-30OR Painted Economy Soprano Ukulele (Orange)]]<br />[[ASIN:B0018TF0O8 Lanikai LU-11 Soprano Ukulele]]<br />[[ASIN:B001LU1SFO Kala KA-15S Mahogany Soprano Ukulele]]<br /><br />The Okina, Diamond Head and Mahalo were all under $30 at the time and within $2 price of each other.  Of the three, I thought that the Mahalo was the best offering both visually and in terms of tone quality.  The Okina had a poor sound quality even compared to my own 20- and 40-year-old ukuleles (which had the original strings).  A string upgrade to Aquila strings helped significantly, but even then, the Okina still had a far worse sound quality at this price level.<br /><br />The Diamond Head and Mahalo both sounded better even with the stock strings, and each includes a nice (for this price) little gig bag.  The Mahalo has the most \\"island\\" look to my eyes and the best sound.  Much of the sound can probably be attributed to the strings which are more substantial than the Diamond Head's.  That being said, it still makes financial and practical sense to get the Mahalo since it's so near the same price (compared to the  Diamond Head) and has heavier strings already installed.  I've also reviewed the Lanikai and Kala on their own pages.<br /><br />On an almost irrelevant note, the Diamond Head was the only instrument of the 5 to arrive in something close to actual tuned-up string tension.  It takes several days for these nylon strings to stretch and settle in, but I didn't have to retune the Diamond Head so much because it was already virtually in tune.  This would not be my primary concern with purchasing an instrument for myself but may be a significant headache-saver for a non-musician parent purchasing a ukulele for a young child.	2013-01-30

Eight is not enough!     Yeah! I had to say it!  3) I got it to close my watch but it damaged my crystal.     My crystal has a raised area around the date for easier reading.     They didn't have a crystal large enough to fit around the outside area of the watch.     I used the largest one to close the watch but the raised area around the date got crushed.    It closed pretty easy so I won't give it 1 star, but it really needs more dies and instructions.    Online I found the product but still no instructions.

Perhaps less creamers would burst during transit if the display box shown was wrapped inside a cardboard box.  The box arrived completely undamaged on the outside. None appeared to have frozen during transit, it appears that the creamer singles pop during high altitude transit or perhaps when the box is thrown by the shipper or pressure is placed on the box.  It is a sticky mess when it arrives.  The creamer taste and convenience is great, but it is unfortunate that so many people have commented on this problem and Interational Delight has not fixed its packaging and shipping issue.	2010-12-17

Strange and sweetened by licorice (which also has a pronounced taste).<br /><br />As a fasting tea, I came to see it as: if you force yourself to drink a cup before a meal, you will lose you appetite entirely. Effective, sure. But certainly unpleasant.

I've had this camera for about a year now and I feel like now is a good time to finally review it. First of all, this is a very nice starter and affordable DSLR for any beginner photographer like myself. Before I got this camera I had very little experience in taking good photos; normally I was just the one to get a compact flash camera to use on our family trips. However the sad thing about this camera is that I didn't know that it didn't have video recording capabilities. So if you are able to spend a little extra money on a new DSLR, then I would advise you to go with getting a D3100. Now, time to do the pros and cons of the camera:<br /><br />-----<br />Pros:<br />- very affordable<br />- very good image quality<br />- very easy to use and not very complicated<br />- very well made; (didn't get too damaged when it fell onto a hard tile floor from four feet)<br />- battery life is decent<br />- portable<br /><br />-----<br />Cons:<br />- flash isn't the best<br />- the strap that comes with it isn't good (the camera fell after the strap came lose around my neck)<br />- no video recording capabilities<br />- not very good indoors<br /><br />Overall this is a very nice camera with a very nice lens. After owning it for about a year, I do think that I will be upgrading once I have the money to a D5100 or to a D7000 since I have become more experienced with DSLRs.	2011-11-26

Without reading the manual, we had no problems taking great shots. The thing my wife likes is that the button for taking a picture has minimal time lag- you press and it takes a shot. Her old one did not do that and caused her to miss many good shots. The shots are very clear and the zoom works great. Nice wide angle as well. No complaints about this camera. We took about 150 pictures using the default setting and the battery still has about 2/3 of its life left. The flash was used for about 15 of the pictures.  We have had this camera for about 1 1/2 weeks. Neither my wife nor myself are expert photographers. Her old camera was a Cannon from Walmart.	2012-01-02

A while ago, I briefly saw a Jill-E camera bag in a local camera store, but at the time couldn't justify the price, especially since I had a perfectly good camera bag, although not very stylish.  Jump forward, I received another lens this Christmas and it won't fit in my existing camera bag.  I remembered liking the feminine qualities and went on the hunt...Found out that I had seen the small version and after reading other consumer reviews realized it was the Medium size that I should get.  When I received the bag it was bigger than what I was expecting, and in fact, has so much room I think my husband and son are afraid I'll soon want another camera.  This bag has the ability to hold two battery charger blocks (and cords), one Pentax 10KD SLR, two lens, one pocket Pentax digital, plus I can throw my wallet, Iphone, keys and a couple other items inside too!  I'm a taller lady (6 feet) and I love the strap length, not quite long enough to comfortably fit over a bulky winter coat, but that is a minor point to me, and otherwise I can put it over my shoulder like any other great bag,plus it comes with a long removable strap.  It looks like a few of my other handbags, only bigger.  I love that is sits flat on the bleachers and when I take out an item, the movable padded dividers make it so nothing falls out of place, and that it doesn't become unbalanced and tip over.  Very customizable on the inside. Tons of pockets.  I do wish that the top zipper opening could be done from either end, but that's also a minor point.  Pictures are very accurate and other reviews are very helpful, great price too!	2011-02-02

I had bought my wife the previous model of this series and she loves it, small, compact, fast, and easy to use. So, when my wife's cousin asked for a recommendation for a camera this was the one I suggested.  It still is a great little camera but there was one modification that Canon made that hurts, they did away with the little view finder, now you can only aim the camera using the LCD.      The one thing that used to set Canon apart in cameras of this type and price range was the optical view finder, it was a great feature for people that take alot of pictures outdoors in sunlight.  You didn't have to try to use the LCD which gets washed out in strong sunlight.    Still a great little camera but Canon should have kept the view finder.	2011-04-14

A friend told me that pretty much everything I do is perfectly 'doable' with PS Elements: photo editing and web graphic creation.     So as Amazon had a great deal on the already low price of PSE (10% of CS4) I decided to try it - I can always return it if it doesn't work for me.    Well I have to tell you my friend was right! PSE is a very powerful tool and everything  need.	2009-05-03

Unfortunately after installing 12.5 a whole new set of issues surfaced.  Instead of pulling my hair out, I uninstalled 12.5 and set up a VPN on my home system and am now using UltraVNC.  It does the same thing and is FREE.  (Did I mention free?)   Save your money.	2009-07-18

Changes to the interface made adding metadata -- even extensive metadata -- even easier than before. A vast array of presets allows you to quickly adjust raw photos, in particular, to improper lighting, getting rid of the jaundiced yellow cast of tungsten or the Avatar-like blue cast of fluorescent lights.    The new geotagging features are very easy to use, though figuring out how wasn't immediately obvious; like most things in Aperture, don't overthink the process and you will do well.    Aperture's ability to create bundled libraries is both a plus and a minus compared to Adobe Lightroom. With Aperture, you can ingest vast quantities of still images (and even video), and then move the entire massive archive as a unit to another drive or server; Lightroom doesn't like such movement, at all. On the other hand, it is easier to add directories of photos to Lightroom, making it a better choice for a quick glance at what you've taken when you don't really have the time or inclination to do some serious cataloging.    Aperture 3 was the first release that struck me, on average, as easier to use than Lightroom. The new support for video and geotagging, the very easy preset corrections for lighting, and other advancements now make it my cataloging tool of choice.	2010-07-18

The back straps are not leather covered and attached with brass tacks (as pictured).  They are all nylon.  The nylon strap is sewn on to the outside covering of padded part of the strap in one small place, which tends to make the covering of the padded part twist around the outside of the pad when you move around. It creates some discomfort and looks very prone to failure in short amount of time.  I guess it was probably done this way in order to reduce the cost of the bag.  I travel a lot and carry my laptop, iPad, etc., so I need durability and comfort.<br /><br />It's too bad, because the leather part of the bag looks great.  If it were the one in the picture I'd keep it, but I'm going to send it back and try something else.	2013-01-11

In the past few years, I've been flying a lot for work.  We all know that airports can be fine or that airports can be a nightmare.  My first trip with this bag, the airport was a nightmare.  Flight was cancelled.  Airline A shifted me to airline B.  Well airline B didn't have my reservation.  You get the picture.  Back and forth between terminals.  I was so angry at the airlines and so upset to not be getting to my destination when I expected.  But I actually stopped to think, \\"man, at least my suitcase is so amazing.\\"  The four wheels are great.  It glides.  If I knew ballet I could incorporate this bag into the most elegant swan dance.  (Samsonite should use that for a commercial!) Jokes aside, this bag really maneuvers well.  So far I've had no problems with overhead compartments like other reviewers apparently have. The handles have extra cushion so even when I've packed it to the gills, it doesn't kill my hand when I have to carry it up stairs or lift it for an overhead bin.  Love this thing!	2013-02-24

I found myself not liking this album as much as previous albums for several reasons. 1.) You do not need profanity to convey a point. If you have to you are doing it wrong. Now I have to go in Audacity and remove that section of audio and hope the song still shows up in the album.  2.) Sharon is an amazing singer, you don't need to make almost half the songs on the album feature another artist, let the girl sing. 3.)Lyrically I have expected more of Within Temptation, the stories and emotions conveyed in their songs have been largely why I like them. So it makes me wonder why they are covering pop songs. Also Dog Days and Edge of the World seemed to be going for a more subdued theme just to be more subdued, not to create a theme of emotion like Forgiven or Memories.  They still, sound good, just not always as good as previous works.	2014-09-01

I will, however, say that this company makes amazing teas. This one is BY FAR my favorite. It has made a world of difference. I have suffered with acne my whole life. As a teenager, I was on antibiotics and other crazy creams and pills. I was a vegan, so it wasn't the &#34;crap I was eating&#34; as most people would say. I used this tea for one month - and I went from having too many pimples to count to one or two. Seriously. Even during &#34;that time&#34; - when you are starving and irritable and your face looks like a pizza - 2-3 pimples. And those pimples weren't even BAD pimples. I did the one week off like the box suggested, and almost immediately started to break out again. That alone tells me this is good stuff. I have started a subscription, as this is one of the only Yogi teas my local market doesn't carry. During my off week, I use the Moon Cycle tea. I have given all of my friends with adult acne a box of this tea, and it is working for them as well. I have never used it as a toner, but I guess you could.	2014-01-09

[VHS]	Video	5	157	172	N	N	You should meet Harry and Sally	Something has always bothered me about romantic comedies, i.e. you rarely actually get to see the couple fall in love, you know, actually witness the growth of the bond between them. They just fall in love, but you don't  really get to be there. Except when you're watching 'When Harry Met Sally'.  Rob Riener made a better film from a Nora Ephron script than she ever  could. No offence to her, she's just a better writer than she is director.  And Meg Ryan is so much better with Billy Crystal than Tom Hanks, although  I have nothing but respect for Mr.Hanks. The thing is that its not just a  genuinely and consistently funny movie, it's also terribly romantic.  It  spans about twleve years in the lives of both Harry and Sally, from their  first meeting at college. They grow and change, they like and dislike each  other, they become romantically involved and then they don't. The whole  thing is very engrossing and witty but never seems far fetched or  fantastical. I rate this movie as a contender for cinema's best romantic  comedy. Enjoy the dialogue, the charm, the music, the drama and melodrama  and give praise to Rob Riener and his magnificant team who made a wonderful  film. The stars have not reunited since and it is possibly for the best as  it would be an extremely difficult task to repeat this kind of quality.  Chemistry and genuine emtion are hard to come by in this genre, enjoy it  while you can. Its available on video and DVD and is rarely edited for T.V.	1999-12-23

Snoop Dogg plays a big time gambler who opens up a casino of his own with the help of the mob.  Eventually complications arise and  the mob is after him.  The film is amazing in appearance as far as the  characters dress and background scenery goes.  However, there is no other  real subtance to the film.  The best part is after the film is over and two  music videos are played.  The second of the two videos is great (lots of  nudity and the song is pretty cool to).  None the less, if you want to see  Snoop Dogg at his best, check out MURDER WAS THE CASE.

The holes don't align with the holes on the slide bracket. Seeing as I cannot attach the brackets to the keyboard tray, I cannot install this piece onto the desk.

This is the first ski video I ever bought.  I liked this video so much that I decided to get the 'BreakThrough On Skis I' as well. I consider myself an intermediate skier. I am fairly good when no bumps and powder are around, although I'm helpless when I have to face bumps and when the slopes start turning challenging. I took a real life lesson on bumps and the instructor was completely worthless. Lito teaches you different levels of bump skiing and tricks to face them. Starting up on smaller ones and moving gradually on to more difficult and challenging ones. With Lito's video you can get a very clear idea of what bumps to attack first, rather than jumping straight into real challenging ones. Now I have a very clear idea of what to do when I have to face this challenging terrain.	2002-01-22

There was good and okay matches.  What was really good about this ppv was that there was no ordinary match.  Either there was a special kind of match or a title was on the line. Here are all the matches and how they were....<BR>#1 WWE Tag Team Championship: Tazz and Spike Dudley vs Dudley Boyz- Good tag team title match.  It was great for Spike because it was his first ppv where he defended a title and all though out of all 4 wrestlers he was the shrimp, but he put 110% in this match.<BR>#2 WWE Intercontinental Championship: Edge vs William Regal- an Okay.  Was exciting because a month before, Edge broke Regal's nose and everybody was proboly wondering what Regal had instore for Edge.  The only thing wrong was the end of the match.  It was dissapointing but the only way to know why is if you get this.<BR>#3 WWE Women's Championship: Trish Stratus vs Jazz-It was alright, the only thing that led to this match was Jazz winning a #1 contender spot for the title ...  What made the match exciting was that Jaqueline became a special guest ref and hated Jazz.<BR>#4 Street Fight: Vince McMahon vs Ric Flair- This owner vs owner match was really good, considering the fact of the men's age. Lots of brutality was in this match.<BR>#5 WWE Undisputed Championship: Chris Jericho (Y2J)vs The Rock- Ever since Jericho costed him and the rock a tag team match back in October against Shane McMahon & RVD, these have 2 been really going at it.  This was real good, there was little interfearence, lots of move countering,lot of suete moves happened such as the Rock rock-botttming Y2J from announce table to another!<BR>#6 Main Event: The Royal Rumble, consisted of 30 men:<BR> 1. Rikishi 2. Goldust 3. Bossman 4. Bradshaw 5. Lance Storm 6. Al Snow 7. Billy Gunn 8. The Undetaker 9. Matt Hardy (with Lita)10. Jeff Hardy 11. Maven 12. Scotty 2 Hotty 13. Christian 14. DDP  15. Chuck 16. The Godfather 17. Albert 18. Perry Saturn 19. Steve Austin 20. Val Venis 21. Test 22. HHH 23. The Hurricane 24. Farooq 25. Mr. Perfect 26. Kurt Angle 27. Big Show 28. Kane 29. RVD 30. Booker T<BR>This was one of the most excing ppv's ever.  Besides Triple H, there were other returns like Goldust, Mr. Perfect, Val Venis, and Godfather.  There was a lot of times where ot seemed some guys were gonna be eliminated but they managed not to.  The 2 most exciting things I thought were the best was Maven,the tough Enough champion, kicking Taker from behind and eliminating and Kane tossing big Show over the top rope.<br />Overall this ppv is good to watch.  I gave 4 stars because there are some disapointments but it was still good.  Buy this.	2002-07-08

I was actually pretty \\"wowed\\" when I took these rugs out of the package, and who doesn't love it when that happens? :) The quality is quite amazing for the price. The colors are bright/vivid, they are a nice thickness, have a high quality look and sheen, and all rugs have a no slip backing, which I also love. I noticed the price fluctuates on this item quite a bit, but if you can catch it on the low end ($45-$50), it's a fantastic deal!	2014-11-17

The directions were easy to follow, and with two people building it, it only took 45 minutes-1 hour.  The only difficult part is making the doors even.

We are using the unit as a kitchen pantry, so it doesn't bother us, but if it were more prominently displayed, it would be an issue.	2014-12-04

The bag is so huge, you can open it and rebag them or box them for smaller packages.<br />It really is a delicious Belgian chocolate - we used to live in Belgium, which made me a chocolate snob, and I think many of the gold coins are nothing more than that cheap, waxy tasting stuff or equivalent to a drug store candy bar.<br /><br />These, on the other hand, have the rich flavor of good chocolate, smooth and creamy, and the coins make them a good size for an occasional treat if you are otherwise likely to overindulge.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend them.<br /><br />There must be 150+ pieces in the bag - I took one to a huge party (about 150-200 adults and kids), spread them around on all the tables and the buffet, and there was definitely enough to go around (granted, all the kids hoarded, adults didn't eat too many). Of course, IMO, good chocolate like this is often wasted on kids! LOL<br /><br />Oh yes - the beautiful bag also makes an excellent, reusable gift bag - we used it a few times during Chanukah.	2009-12-19

I used this on my trips from Philadelphia to Niagra Falls and Philadelphia to Washington DC without any problems.  I will say that the gps would sometimes not be recognized or at least pick up a signal sometimes when running the application so I had to restart the application and sometimes my laptop for it to work.  Not sure if that was just my computer but just reporting that it happened while using.  I like how easy it is to use and you can see lots of roads around you and not just what a small gps only unit would show.  I like the fuel calculating feature and the speed display on the unit as well.

While ambitious in its attempt at &quot;alternative&quot; cinema, the video's novice  production values (in black and white) and droning narration by Lydia Lunch  come off more as an eager art school project than a masterpiece of  underground movie-making. For hardcore fans of Lydia Lunch and Richard  Kern, though, this new issue of short films will be a welcome addition (if  you don't already own the original Film Threat Videdo releases).	2000-04-03

This is a movie that oozes that non-descript term 'class', where every aspect of the movie-making process simply fuses together like it was just meant to be.  This is a true 'classic'.  Watch this film to lift your  spirits.  Although impossibly romantic, the story of two sisters in their  pursuit of love offers much hope to a 'dumpee' - they find love in the end  after all the hardship.  The basic message - that 'everything will be OK in  the end' - is as important today as it was all those years ago.  More  important: this movie inspires hope, whilst restoring faith in life.  The  acting is superb accross the entire cast, and the age difference between  the two sisters is perfectly apt - emphasising vividly the differences  between sense and sensibility.  However, I recommend multiple viewings to  fully appreciate the multi-layered depths of the leading, Academy Award  nominated performances from Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet.  The finely  executed, educated script is divine.  No Oscar-winning script has ever been  so polished or deserved before or since.  All this brought together by the  detail oriented direction by Ang Lee - who's outstanding work never diverts  attention from the story or characters.  Forget Braveheart - this was the  more truthful, moving and funny cinematic tour de force of 1995 - truly  deserving of the Best Picture Academy Award nomination - for excellence in  film - it should have won.	2000-05-09

Someone had commented that the rug was darker than they expected.  The rug we received was the exact same color as the picture.<br /><br />We are extremely happy with our rug and would purchase another in an instant if needed.	2015-04-22

They were completely flattened in a couple days. The foam inside the seat and knee rest is very thin and is easily flattened permanently. I am 5'9&#34; 155 lbs and it is a comfortable fit I just wish it has some decent pads. I would not buy again... if you can find the chair style with better pads it would be worth an extra 20-50 dollars.	2015-05-01

We have wireless internet. With some trepidation, I ordered the download version, which was as much a piece of cake as any software installation I've ever done. Yeah, it takes maybe two hours, which includes acquiring the inevitable updates, but it's snowing like hell here, so what else was I going to do? And yes, the 2011 version of Word will require you to learn how to use their new &#34;ribbon&#34; system, but pull up the Big Girl Panties and buy yourself one of those &#34;Word 2011 Introduction&#34; laminated double-sided cheat sheets, and DEAL.

If you know Michael Franti's/Spearhead's music and don't own this album, do yourself a favor and purchase it.

The price is a tad low and Martin is strict about selling new guitars only to reputable dealers.  E.g., Musician's Friends has them available for $8249, and MF is commonly close to the lowest market price. This price is surely possible if the dealer has a good volume of the guitars.  This is not such a dealer.  This is likely a used guitar that was not played —perhaps someone in over their head or perhaps buyer's remorse.  They probably have not filled out the warranty card and think that this means the guitar can be sold as new.  Nope.  The original buyer is the original buyer -no way around this.  Martin keeps careful tabs on this.  Martin has the best warranty in the business and they back it up. (Unlike Santa Cruz, for example).<br /><br />If this is a person whom simply did not want that guitar after purchase, I recommend simple honesty.  It is still a pristine Martin (perhaps).  Yes, without the famous lifetime warranty, but the present owner should not loose more than 20% if the guitar is pristine and has not been sitting in a case for more than 2 - 3 months.<br /><br />For any buyer of a D-45, I, like Fred Martin, would suggest that you save  money on pearl and buy a model 28 or 21 of some type!  As Fred wrote Jimmie Rodgers, 'Pearl will not make the guitar sound or play better...'.  Psst; The Collings Company in TX builds them BETTER than Martin did in the 1930s!<br /><br />Warning: I have seen guitars dried out beyond repair in as little as 6 months. (depends upon location and treatment). Likewise, I have seen Florida destroy a guitar in 3 months if it has not been kept properly in the case.<br /><br />Regardless, I recommend buying such an item in person.  They usually run in the neighbourhood of  $8,500 new.  No two Martin D-45s are the same, just as no two pieces of spruce are the same.  Plus each player has his style and is looking for something unique to fit his preference.	2015-05-20

This is a classy, high quality timepiece at a reasonable price. I bought this watch in February, it was a gift for my boyfriend. It was for our Anniversary in April, I was very disappointed when the band was WAY too large for his wrist. We took it to a watch repair shop to see about having it adjusted but were disappointed once again when the only option was to move the pins in the clasp due to the mesh band  and even then it was STILL too big. My boyfriend really loves the watch so he doesn't want to return it, the only option left is to see about a new band. I found a steel mesh band here on Amazon  but I don't know if it's compatible or if it will look good  because it's from a different company.	2013-04-27

[[VIDEOID:mo23ELP23Z6NVFU]]This watch is everything I was looking for. I needed a watch that could withstand the rigors of sailing and this one clearly does.  It's a little on the bulky side but since it had every feature I figured it had to be bulky to pack it all in.<br /><br />Military time for plotting charts,<br />Hourly alarm to remind me to plot charts every top of the hour<br />Calendar to know what day it is<br />Water Proof to I think 600 feet AWESOME FEATURE!<br />Indigo light button to see at night<br /><br />It would be nice to have more color choices but I can live with that.  I need to plot charts every top of the hour & the alarm helps to remind me of that I also need to learn to memorize military time for plotting charts and this watch allows me to do so.  The price was very reasonable ($50 bucks) I only gave the 4 stars due to it's lack of color selections and the bulkiness otherwise it'd be a solid 5 stars!!<br /><br />The video will show just how thick the watch is on my wrist.  If you can live with that, then this watch will NOT disappoint you.	2011-08-29

Great, so I bought it. Now, here's the deal, I don't know if it was the Frog Tongue or the film itself but... I spent a lot of time researching exactly how to shoot the film and what to do after, I kept in mind what to do for different settings and times of day and available light blah blah blah; I followed all the directions, I timed everything to the second...and my pictures came out pretty crappy. They didn't develop very clearly, the colors weren't true to my subject, everything had a sepia tint, and the picture were just pretty faint in general. I doubt it was due to my camera being faulty because it's in really great condition. Maybe the frog tongue is crappy or I just got a crappy bunch of film, but I'm tellin' ya, I took multiple shots and I followed ALL their 50 million directions to the dot and my pictures still did not come out well.<br /><br />Conclusion: Even if you follow all the guidelines associated with your camera, the &#34;Impossible PRD2186 PX 680 Color Shade Cool Film for Polaroid 600,&#34; and the frog tongue, your pictures still may not come out very well. Although, it is debatable whether this is because of my camera, the IMPOSSIBLE film, or the Frog Tongue itself.	2013-09-16

It's a good starter smartwatch. It was a bit difficult to get setup and get used to, but the customer support (overnight emails) was good. I synched it to my Android Droid 4. It is a little larger than I would like and the (reflective) screen takes some getting used to. I loaded the Metawatch Manager Noah Edition, as it got the best reviews and is more flexible than the standard watch manager. I had problem with Calendar notifications, so deleted them from the watch, but use the Phone battery, Call, Text, and Gmail notifications and they work OK. Because it is bluetoothed direct to the phone, I was expecting immediate notifications (when the watch vibrated), but there is a little delay. I had another \\"freeze up\\" last night after recharging, but a hard boot (2 middle buttons) fixed that. There are 3 available boots, but only one was in the documentation (the rest you get from Support). Not bad for a starter smartwatch.	2013-07-29

I had bought a mighty mule detector but took it back when I found this unit. Testing was simple. I am just over a 1/4 mile from the transmitter box 3 ft up on a railroad tie fence corner post which is also black so the transmitter blends perfectly. Plenty of cable to get 20+ ft between the probe and the transmitter. Got it in just before the snow came and it has worked perfectly every time and I have even moved the receiver around the house and it always triggers. Some of the button presses to set modes are a little odd like .5sec B button for exit delay but if you press too long it sets off the alarm to do another function.  I wish it had a battery backup so it wouldn't sound when moving the receiver around the house on powerup. I will get a second probe and transmitter and try it about 1/2 mile up the drive for earlier warning but neighbors also use my drive occasionally. Anxious to connect to ZWave switches per YouTube video to trigger events/actions based on driveway alarm trigger.	2015-01-12

She's been wanting me to teach her to play for some time now. It comes with a pick, a tuning harp, a strap, extra strings, and a cheap case that provides no protection for this wanna-be instrument. The neck has no markings on it, so it's really tough to see what fret you're on. The strings sit about 1/4 inch away from the guitar, making it horrible to play. The strings seem to be made of tin, and it's impossible to tune properly, even with quality strings. It looks nice, but it's not what I would consider to be an instrument. It's really not worth the cost of the shipping unless you're giving it to a child who will just end up ruining it anyway.	2014-02-22

A lot of folks reviewing the S-1 complained that they could not read the display because they were not able to rotate the screen for a better view. Booshwah! If you read the instructions they tell you how to position the Mini for optimal viewing. Okay, you may need to lean the top of your guitar away from you a little for the brightest display but in my opinion that's a very minor inconvenience. If your guitar detunes so frequently that you constantly need to see the tuner at a glance, you might want to consider getting a guitar that will stay in tune. Also, the display on the S-3 shows a wider optimum range (green zone) than any of the other SNARK products and displays are updated much faster on the S-3. Additionally, the scale on the S-3's display runs from lower left corner to upper right corner instead of from side to side making it even easier to read when properly positioned on the tuning head.<br />I guess the bottom line is don't give up on the SNARK Mini series, just get an S-3.	2014-03-05

For some reason, Netflix wasn't quite as great for an older Doctor Who episode--it looked quite a bit better via AmazonOnDemand, which was free w/ our Prime account). Overall, we're really pleased and happy that we're cutting the cord w/ cable.	2013-04-02

The only reason to not get this lens if you're looking for a 70-300 AF-S lens is if you can afford or are willing to spend three times as much for the Nikon 70-300 VR lens.	2010-03-01

It plays video with no conversion! Stick in a SD card with AVI's, etc. and it plays them fast and consecutively with no hitches. Of course it also displays your jpgs just fine. The image quality is quite \\"acceptable\\" at the right angle. I mean for what this thing costs, I find it bloody amazing.    It only comes with an A/C plug which limits portability. Apparently you can buy a battery for it but I don't need that. You could use a standard inverter in a car with a cigarette lighter adapter if you need car use without the battery. I have a couple already to use laptops in the car.    The screen size is pretty decent. Again for the price the whole thing is a genuine bargain.	2010-03-18

First I'd like to say that the L810 takes really good pictures and I love the 26x Zoom even though that kind of zoom won't be used a lot in my case but its good to have it just in case.  At first when I was looking for a new camera I was attracted to the Nikon Coolpix L610 for the 1080P video recording compared to the L810's 720P video recording but after doing further research I found that the L810 was an overall better camera so I was willing to compromise on HD video quality.  The things that are key to me are the camera's size (I don't want a small camera) and how it fits in my hands when using it and I'm glad to say that the L810 is just the right size for me and it fits comfortably in my hands when I'm taking photos with it.  The biggest test for the Nikon Coolpix L810 was taking photos inside my room which has the worst lighting to take photos in especially without the flash open which my old Kodak didn't do very well in.  When I took photos in my room with my Kodak camera with the flash closed the photos would always be grainy but when I took a photo with the Nikon without the flash it came out smooth which is great because some photos I take are in my room and sometimes I try not to use the flash if I can.  I did notice however that the Nikon Coolpix L810 definitely isn't a camera to take very quick shots with but that isn't too much of a problem for me since the pictures I take aren't split second shots.  Overall I think the Nikon Coolpix L810 was the best choice for someone like me who does casual photography and wants to upgrade from an older camera.	2013-01-12

It's a meaningful song with a lot of heartfelt emotion. \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\" is easy on the ear; the pretty arrangement for this love song charms me every time I hear it. \\"Message to Michael (aka Message To Martha)\\" is very well done and I also really like \\"Walk on By.\\" \\"Walk on By\\" got lots of airplay when it was released and it deserved it--what an awesome song! \\"Walk on By\\" was even inducted into The Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. \\"A House Is Not a Home\\" again showcases Dionne in her natural element and she delivers this like the pro she is and always will remain.<br /><br />Dionne Warwick fans will probably have these numbers already but if they're missing a track or two they should definitely download this music now! This is an excellent sampling of Dionne Warwick's artistry; newcomers and casual fans alike will love her music and they should get more comprehensive albums and CD box sets by Dionne Warwick.	2012-09-09

I happened to find a bottle of this at Marshall's on clearance and figured it looked good, it's $1.50 how bad could it be? If it tastes terrible who cares it's just $1.50. I was amazed at the way you activate the flavor, it was ingenious and the taste was so fresh! I happened to be looking for something else on Amazon and came across Activate Drinks. I was thrilled and automatically ordered a case of the orange flavor. I'm almost down to my last bottle and was looking to order the variety case, unfortunately they are out of it. I think this is a great product for kids who don't like the taste of plain water. The packaging alone will excite them!! They get to turn the top and the flavor releases freshly into the water, shake the bottle to make sure there's no sediment on the bottom, then bottoms up and enjoy. The orange flavor has a great tangy orange flavor and has only 5 calories in a 16 ounce bottle. What a great concept!!!	2010-09-08

I will say that these are so comfortable that when I lost my last set, I re-purchased the exact same. They sit completely recessed in the ear so they fit well under helmets are even comfortable to sleep in. The cords are relatively tangle free, and the seal out outside noise extremely well. I use them to monitor audio when shooting video in loud environments, when mowing the grass, running the river on my boat, and for listening to audio books when I go to bed. I've used a lot of in-ear monitors from Shure, Bose & Etymotics but these are by far the most comfortable.	2012-11-26

The simple mystery of &quot;Who killed Laura Palmer ?&quot; is only the surface of a deep exploration into hidden worlds of good and evil with an incredibly colorful cast of characters mixed with director David Lynch's physical incarnation of metaphysical worlds and entities.<br />Even if you have seen the movie Fire Walk With Me (which answers the mystery), the series still has a grossly magnetic appeal as its characters' own stories and relationships unfold among a backdrop of Lynch's esoteric imagery. <br />Personally, I cannot get enough.  I have just watched the first tape of 5 episodes (which I borrowed while waiting for mine to arrive) and cannot wait to watch the rest. With lots of hidden symbols and images (check out some of the Twin Peaks websites via your favorite search engine), this series is worth(and requires) watching more than once.      END	1998-06-14

So \\"clean\\" players love 'em, but many hard rockers have embraced the 12L. I've been playing for 36 years, hundreds of gigs under my belt, and I've tried all sorts of gear... but I keep coming back to the pair of 12L's I bought USED in 1978.<br /><br />They're mammoth things - the magnet alone weights 16 pounds (!) and it's attached to a cast aluminum basket. A 2x12 cab with 'em needs wheels. They're pricey - really pricey. But that sound...<br /><br />The thing about the 12L to me? I call them \\"b*tch slap\\" speakers. There's something about how responsive they are at a decent volume level - a hard hitting chord or note just seems to \\"thwack\\" you in the face. I recorded some tracks in the 90's that had sort of a hard, U2 vibe. At the time, one of my 12L's was in a garbage slant monitor cab, powered by a Peavey Classic 30 and mic'd with a Sure 57. To this day, the opening chords of that recording are one of the best sounds I ever achieved - as are the backing tracks and the solo. People use the word \\"punchy\\", but this tune punches you in the jaw. Today, I have one 12L in a small cab for my studio, and one in a 2x12 cab (along with a 70's vintage JBL K120 pulled from an old Fender Twin... keeps the weight down!), powered by an Egnater Tweaker head. Tone heaven.<br /><br />I dunno - it's not like you can grab a pair of these, install them into your cab, and test drive 'em with your rig. They're not for everybody, but if you can find a way to try your amp and setup through a 12L loaded cabinet - at stage volume levels - give it a shot and see if the grin on your face is as big as mine.	2012-02-10

I figured I would try to find a good cart under $100, and this one so far is great. It comes in a protective metal box that has foam inside to surround and protect the cart.

One of the reviewers is correct in that \\"John Heard\\" is NOT in Silence of the North, but incorrect on the name \\"John Pinsent\\".  The actors name is \\"Gordon Pinsent\\" who plays \\"John Frederickson\\", who rescues Walter and Olive (changed her name from \\"Alta\\") Reamer and their baby daughter from certain death in the frozen wilderness, and, who Olive eventually marries after Walter drownes while heading back into the deep Northwest, alone.  Also, contrary to what some other reviewers are saying, the film is NOT set in Alaska or British Columbia, and has nothing to do with the \\"Gold Rush\\".  It takes place in Northern Alberta, Canada (Peace River), and subsequently deep into the Northwest Territories where \\"fur trapper\\" Walter Reamer (Tom Skerritt) roams and dreams of becoming wealthy from the pelts of beaver and muskrat, as he assures Olive that \\"It's better than gold\\".  The theme song is \\"Comes A Time\\", written by Neil Young and sung by Lacy J.Dalton. Rest assured that this posting comes to you, as in the words of John Frederickson, \\"Without a word of a lie\\".	2008-02-14

The advocates for nuclear power tell us that nuclear is safe and cheap.  If this is true then why can't the power companies get the insurance industry to insure their plants?  Why is the Price Anderson Act (which puts nuclear waste accident cleanup costs on the backs of the taxpayer) renewed every so many years to protect the nuclear power companies from paying for potential damages & accidents that could (and have in the past) occur?

Definately a great price on this watch. I had just looked at this watch at a large retail store and Amazon's price beat their 10% discounted price by about $425.00. The watch came as presented, new, in the box, with all paperwork. Very nice  purchase experience. My only concern is the fact that the watch was shipped with no signature required, since it falls below Amazon's dollar amount of $700. Not a good policy on a valuable item such as this.	2009-06-25

Strange Confession - Having never seen \\"The Man Who Reclaimed His Head\\"--which this film is apparently based on--I had nothing to compare it to, so the idea of the movie seemed fresh to me & as far as the Inner Sanctum Mysteries go, this was perhaps the best of the six--a compelling little drama where once again you can feel Lon Chaney's agony & torment.    Chaney to me was a very gifted actor--especially when it came to playing on the audience's sympathies. Whether or not Lon could have played a leading man may be up for some debate amongst critics and fans; seemingly, Lon wanted to do more than just be a \\"horror man\\", which may have attributed to some of the man's personal demons.    But, all that aside, \\"Strange Confession\\" is a great movie. J. Carrol Naish was suitably slimy in his role--a role that at first I didn't recognize him in given that I'm so used to seeing him as the hunchback Daniel from \\"House of Frankenstein.\\" Brenda Joyce has good chemistry with Lon & the story flows along nicely.    Perhaps the mystery of this one is what exactly is inside that bag Lon Chaney's character has with him. One can make a very educated guess after watching the movie, but I won't spoil anything.  5 stars    Calling Dr. Death - Another good Inner Sanctum mystery which cast Lon as a prominent psychiatrist trapped in a loveless marriage & entangled in a romance with his lovely secretary. One day, the doctor's wife is brutally murdered & this leads into a rather involving whodunit as the police and Lon try to figure out who the culprit is. 4 stars    Overall--if you're a Lon Chaney fan--then this Inner Sanctum double feature is a must see.	2015-02-16

I have a gluten sensitivity and just do better gluten-free.  I have lost 62 pounds since going gluten and dairy free, but it is challenging to make comfort foods.  Since I don't do corn either, the corn based products don't work for me.  This is brown rice, plain and simple.  It satisfies that desire for old-fashioned spaghetti, without causing digestive upset.  I'm so happy to have found this brand.  It costs half of a similar product I have bought locally and buying in bulk allows me to have it on hand when I get the hankering for spaghetti!	2013-10-19

Burt Lancaster plays a stolid, depedable foster son who reluctantly has to face down his reckless foster brother played by Robert Walker.  Walker and Lancaster play off each other well, their naturally opposing acting styles heightning the conflict between these two.  Unfortunately, Robert Walker, who made quite an impression in his short film career -- especially in  Hitchcock's &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; -- would be dead shortly after this film was released.  A sad footnote to an overlooked but interesting film.	2001-04-10

We were in New York City a few days last year and found this pancake mix in the store near our hotel.  We really loved the taste of these moist, fluffy, wheat pancakes right off the griddle.  After returning to Utah we looked for this same mix but found it nowhere.  In fact it was almost impossible to find a mix that wasn't 'just-add-water'.  Apparently the grocery retailers here believe everyone prefers the cardboard taste of the just-add-water pancakes.  We did find one other whole wheat mix that you add egg and milk to but it just didn't have the great taste the Aunt Jemima pancakes have.  We also found the original Aunt Jemima mix which we like but we really prefer the whole wheat.  We have mostly used Bisquick in the past and substituted some whole wheat flour but, again, the Aunt Jemima mix tastes much better.  We were really delighted and thankful to find the Aunt Jemima whole wheat mix on Amazon.  Including shipping, the 6-pack is only a little more than other mixes in the grocery store and less than the price in New York City.	2014-05-12

Gone are the mighty and high Kaspersky days. Pure user for few years now, but with recent upgrade to Win 8.1 it has been nothing but headaches and licensing issues - 3 months without protection until they released a patch in late Dec 13, and they will not even have a courtesy to extend the previous license which did not work for 3 months. They spam my email everyday to buy at some f'in exorbitant rate. Seems like they have become greedy as they have grown, a sure sign of downward slope for such companies. I now started hating Kaspersky products and their licensing practices. To all Kaspersky users out there, let this be a warning / caution.	2014-01-10

The most important thing to know about this device is that it does not work with the Hero 3 Black it only works with the Hero 3+ Black (and of course you need two 3+'s) ; I found that out the hard way but opted to sell off my old black for the black 3+ and everything is peachy.<br /><br />The device is ridiculously easy to use, just put the sync cable on and whatever the main camera does the 2nd one does and that includes if you change your settings.  It's like operating an over-sized go pro.<br /><br />The free editing software from GoPro will do the file merge; simply create a folder for your project and drag the two video folder files from each 3+ camera to it and the GoPro Software will marry the two sides. There is a great YouTube video from GoPro on convergence setting you may want to check out but from there you can either finish your edit in the GoPro software or use a program like Sony Vegas etc...<br /><br />As for the 3D...awesome. It's everything we all love about GoPro footage but in perfect 3D. Watching the clips on a 3D TV is too cool and you may never want to shoot 2d again.	2014-09-22

Don Gibson penned so many great country songs and had many hits but never quite got the recognition he deserved. The Song I May Never Get To Heaven is, in my opinion, his best work. Conway had a hit with it but to me it doesn't compare to Don's version. Prior to Amazon listing it as an MP3 selection the only cd version was in an expensive box set. Now I can replace my scratchy vinyl version with this one. Thanks Amazon.	2013-01-10

I feel like I did the day I got my first set of Legos.  I'm a novice at best when it comes to HD, but I'm a hardcore bargain hunter, and I visited almost every major and a few minor TV stores comparing picture and price, my two purchase points.  I got it at the holiday sale for only $1500.  I don't know that you'll find it for this once the sale ends, but if you do, you will love this TV. At $1500 it destroys anything else in this price range.  At $2,200 it was still one of my top choices.  I would buy again.	2007-12-20

Only recently, however, did we become aware of the Blueberry Pomegranate variety. Like the other Darrell Lea products, this variety comes in very soft tubes and is really easy to eat. Unlike many forms of licorice, it takes a minimal amount of chewing and doesn't stick to the teeth. And the individual tubes don't stick to each other, which is nice. As to flavor, the Blueberry Pomegranate is unique. It's pleasant, sweet, and somewhat delicate, definitely not overpowering. This is definitely a candy worth trying.	2014-09-17

The instructions were clear and complete. Everything worked the first time. Setup took five minutes and that counts the unpacking. It takes me longer to open a new CD than it did setting up this unit.    I bought this for my son so he could watch TV while away at college. Unfortunately, he has trouble watching from his apartment, but that is because of ISP problems. He can watch from any other wireless hotspot on campus or the neighboring town.    It's best for watching one channel continuously instead of channel surfing because the remote can be difficult to use, but I'm fine with that because that's how I watch TV. I will usually put a ballgame on and leave it there.    I watch football games on it from my netbook computer. The image and quality are great even on the small screen. The only problem I have is that the screen is too small for the \\"remote control\\" so I have to change channels one click at a time instead of entering the channel number. Also, I wish that there was a simple way to tell what channel I'm watching.	2009-09-27

I first heard this band live as an opening act in the late 1970's and was totally blown away.  In my opinion they were so much better than the band they were opening for I don't really remember who they played for.  This is who John Waite played and sang with for a few years til the band broke up.  They never made it really big but should have, they were talented and unique like some of the other great British bands that came out of England.  I'm so glad this was re-issued so that many other people can enjoy their talent as well.  I would most definitely recommend them to anyone looking for soft rock or pop rock and want to listen to a top notch band.  John Waite turned edgier after he played with them but at least he got the fame he deserved.	2011-11-28

My new Nikon D-7100 together with my 17-55 F2.8 DX zoom (which is a large and heavy piece of glass) fit inside the bottom compartment.  It lays flat, stays snug and well padded and is nicely protected.  There is still room for 2 more zoom lenses and extra batteries and memory cards as well.  The upper department holds my extras and it is well designed to store most everything I need on a day long shooting trip.  Bravo to Tenba for coming up with a perfect pack for demanding and hard to please photographers.  The one drawback for some might be the color.  I usually go for a standard BLACK bag, but this Krypton Green was the color I chose and glad that I did because it is so different.	2013-04-13

Look no further	Two words. \\"Freaking awesome.\\"  I would use a different word than \\"freaking\\", but we're in a PG environment here...    Anyway, I'm a college guy. We have a huge tan wall in our apartment this year. This projector looks EXCELLENT, even on a tan colored wall.  Projector is 14' away, and we're getting a 125\\" picture. Funny thing is, that's the smallest we could get it at that distance.     Clear. Massive. \\"Freaking awesome.\\"  Video games, sports, movies, etc...all look fantastic.  For the price, you can't beat it.    People complain about \\"black levels\\" on this projector, but here's the thing: If you've never owned a projector, you would really never know how \\"horrible\\" the blacks are (I think they look pretty black).  I was thinking about getting the Optoma HD66, solely based on the black levels.  I feel like that's a mistake.    You can't go wrong with the 2 year warranty from Epson, plus the bulb life on this thing is supposed to be excellent. Cheaper replacement bulbs than most companies as well (~200 bucks, from what i've read). Wonderful product.    College students. Buy it. Your little apartment turns into a theater. Sick nasty.	2010-09-26

Unfortunately, I hadn't paid much attention to the many extremely negative reviews of this product on Amazon.  This was my mistake, and after an excruciatingly frustrating day spent attempting to assemble this dresser, I now fully understand other reviewers' frustrations.     Please listen to the abundant negative reviews describing difficult if not impossible assembly.  Assembly was difficult, but possible, until I reached the penultimate step of connecting the dresser frame.  The pre-drilled holes on the dresser did not line up as specified, making correct assembly impossible.  This was exactly the problem other reviewers described, and in hindsight, I should have listened to their advice and avoided this product.     Instead, I am stuck with a poorly assembled, barely functional dresser that I will choose to keep, rather than going through the hassle of investing more effort to disassemble this, pack it, then lug its 100 lb package to the post office for a return, and finally, to repeat the entire process from step 1 with another dresser.    Please, please, please avoid to save yourself countless time and frustration.	2011-02-12

The lesson I learned was a bit different from what other reviewers have commented on. One commented on watching this movie as a child. I suppose I relate to that most of all. I saw Seller's performance as eerily autistic, not retarded. His imitation of hand motions, the lack of empthy or emotion... etc. Autism (at least semi functional autism) to me is not lack of intelligence but freedom from those things that impair us. Chance was so simple in a perfect kind of way. His garden and his tv were enought to satisfy him. He made no judgement of anyone around him either. The ending to me, showed him as I've always imagined god to be. Uncomplicated and bereft of those emotions which set us against one another.	2004-12-29

I love yoga and thought this was the most boring and sleepy yoga tape I ever saw. The plain white room and monotone voice made me catatonic every time. You are mostly forced to use props (which also annoyed me) and as for the poses, it is not the easiest tape for the beginner. I might recommend this more to an intermediate. Honestly, for me, I thought the Yoga Zone collections were much more interesting.	2001-10-29

I got this Model instead of the 32PFL5403D/27. But this one has 4 HDMI inputs, the models i wanted has 2 HDMI inputs. Also it has 8ms response time, the other model had 4ms. But i really like this TV. Its an extremely attracting TV. Everyone complements on it's style. It's picture quality is great too, I use this TV for my PS3. The TV is very light weight, which is good. The remote is also light weight lol. The Tv can swirl left to right,which is good but not up and down. The surround is very loud on sound effects when turned on. But the speaking volume stays the same. The only thing i don't like, is that i have to clean the bezel around the screen, because it attracts dust very fast, i don't know why. But don't get me wrong i just clean it will cloth and it reflects so well as the picture, very clean and shiny.    Overall i wouldn't of preferred any other Tv.  EDIT: After 3months and 1 week, the tv screen scrambled and after so many tries it was concluded that the panel was faulty, and was advised to buy a new tv rather than spend $800 to fix it. My best advice is get extra warranty or buy in store, do no rely on the default 3 month warranty like i did. i actually ordered the 32pfl5403d/27 but was given this; 32pfl5403d/F7, whatever.	2009-03-22

In FIELD OF HONOR you might gain a little insight into the French-Prussian War and the lottery-draft selection that France had in place in 1869,but little else can be gained from watching this dreadfully acted and tedious 1988 film directed by Jean-Pierre Denis.It is very much an 1980's French arthouse film chock full of  symbolism framed by a truly bizarre soundtrack that seems to be characteristic of this genre.The story is extremely static and the characters fit the bill.It IS beautifully filmed, though, and for that I can at least give it two stars,but not a farthing more!THE RETURE OF MARTIN GUERRE IS FAR SUPERIOR FILM.	2007-02-14

My daughter received this for her birthday today.  She was so excited, so we opened it right away and put batteries in it for her.  First of all, once the camera is on, you have to hold the button down for several seconds before it will actually take a picture, so most of the pics that she took were of headless people or the floor.  Then, if you press the delete button (it's green with an X on it) twice, then it will erase the pictures.  Of course she doesn't remember that she's not supposed to press THAT button.  There are only five buttons on the camera, so of course any kid is going to be pressing all of the buttons trying to figure out what they do.  So, now my daughter is in bed and I'm cleaning up and notice that the LCD screen is still on.  I push the power button and it won't turn off.  Also, the pictures that are on the camera cannot be downloaded (I tried).  I haven't experienced if it erases the pics when the camera is turned off, because it won't turn off.  This will be returned to the store tomorrow.  What a waste of money!  I won't be exchanging it for another, that's for sure!	2009-11-23

I asked if this was Gmo free and haven't been given an answer yet. A bit pricey for something that's not organic. I tried it once, didn't care for it. I gave the rest away. I'm hoping that it was just that batch because other reviews said it was good. If they say its Gmo free I'll try it again.	2013-05-11

I would not recomend this camera for anybody it is overpriced for what it does. I dont think you could use this at all for fast action capture.

It may sound like a good deal but it isnt, because even out side in bright sunny light my pictures came out badly when holding the camera very still.	2004-06-10

I was immediately able to take advantage of the flexible functionality of the device in my recliner chair.  I plan to use it for support for books, as much as for support of my laptop.  The supports are designed to help hold a book open, and seem to be relatively sturdy.<br /><br />My only concern is the possible vulnerability to breakage of these plastic supports, because they protrude at their attachment to the bottom of the tray.  It may behoove the manufacturer to supply a couple of extra of these supports with the purchase of the stand.	2012-08-16
